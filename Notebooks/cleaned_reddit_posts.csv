Remember the point of this subreddit: HARM REDUCTION,"I just wanted to take a second and remind everyone what this subreddit is ultimately about, harm reduction. Over the last few days I have seen people ask a question and the vast majority of the comments people make are something along the line of, 'you are stupid, just don't do it.' I understand where everyone is coming from, but at the end of the day a person is going to make whatever choice they are going to make. It is not our job to judge someone or put them down for the decision they are making, but it is to keep them as safe as possible when doing it.

I am not talking about just flat out allowing someone to do something that is incredibly dangerous or foolhardy, but something like safe injection practices. It's okay to share your opinion, story or try to dissuade someone from doing something, but there is no need to ridicule someone in the process. 

Opioids are inherently dangerous, don't make the situation worse by not giving someone the advice and knowledge they took the time to seek out. There is a wealth of knowledge and experience in this subreddit, let's use it for good. 

Thank you,

Oxy is better than friends/girls,"Of course that is just my personal opinion,after thinking about this for a lot of time,i decided that an OxyContin pill is def better than anything you can experiece with a girl or with a friend fr.
Lets be honest,people are not perfect,maybe at the start of a relationship or a friendship you can think:oh yeah its very nice to talk to this person,to spent time with him/her,etc
But after some weeks,months or years,something will happen and the person that you like and it can be your best friend or girlfried etc,will change,and maybe that person will lie,cheat,and do awful things to you,and i think that is more dangerous than Oxys lol
The Oxy is always real(🇮🇹),you dont have to worry about nothing,the only worries when u are on Oxys is to get the next prescription fr
An Oxy will always give you a nice body high,and it will never change.
I feel really stressed just to think about a friend or a girl,i just have thoughts like,what are we going to do?Is that relationship worth it?
Nah, i just choose Oxys instead of people :)
Its simple,i take a pill,i have a nice cup of coffee or anything that i like to drink,i have a nice cig and thats all am happy with this,i dont need more people anymore in my life
Thank u all guys,happy nodding to everyone ;)

Poppy cascade,"I feel like most people don't even realize that it's completely legal to buy opium poppy seeds and also legal to grow them. Especially if you manage to grow them indoors since obviously nobody would even know you're doing it to begin with lol. It only becomes illegal once you score them. I took this into my own hands by hitting up all of my plugs I've ever had that I could still get in touch with, and I gave out a ton of seeds to the ones that agreed. I told them that whenever someone buys just throw in an extra bag of seeds for free. I get about 70% germination in the ones that I grow now purely for ornamental flower purposes, they're surprisingly good. 

I want a cascade of people growing their own poppies even if it only ever stays local. Grow them, pass on the seeds you don't need to other people in need. I want people to have access to something other than these fucked up tranqed out frankensteined fentalogues, I'm just so tired of watching people drop dead left and right. I'm also tired of pain patients like myself being tortured with undertreatment and being completely powerless to do anything other than use mystery street garbage. I want an opium poppy revolution, poppies everywhere, too many to possibly manage anymore. Hell just start dumping seeds all over the woods too while you're at it. So far everyone has been really receptive of it from what my plugs tell me, it gives me hope. I'm not sure why but anecdotally raw opium has always cut through and worked on my pain/withdrawals even when my tolerance was shot from tons of oxy or fent etc, it always helped tremendously no matter what for some reason and it's my favorite substance. You need a lot of plants for it to be worth it but it's completely doable, especially if you just find a spot somewhere where you can just dump thousands of seeds like crazy. At this point even if someone only grows a single plant it's still helping the chain. The goal isn't for everyone to become a professional poppy farmer, it's just to make access to opium poppies common enough that it'd be completely impossible to control it in the event they're ever cracked down on.",7,5,2025-01-26 08:33:33,poppy cascade feel like people n't even realize 's completely legal buy opium poppy seeds also legal grow especially manage grow indoors since obviously nobody would even know 're begin lol becomes illegal score took hands hitting plugs 've ever could still get touch gave ton seeds ones agreed told whenever someone buys throw extra bag seeds free get 70 germination ones grow purely ornamental flower purposes 're surprisingly good want cascade people growing poppies even ever stays local grow pass seeds n't need people need want people access something fucked tranqed frankensteined fentalogues 'm tired watching people drop dead left right 'm also tired pain patients like tortured undertreatment completely powerless anything use mystery street garbage want opium poppy revolution poppies everywhere many possibly manage anymore hell start dumping seeds woods 're far everyone really receptive plugs tell gives hope 'm sure anecdotally raw opium always cut worked pain/withdrawals even tolerance shot tons oxy fent etc always helped tremendously matter reason 's favorite substance need lot plants worth 's completely doable especially find spot somewhere dump thousands seeds like crazy point even someone grows single plant 's still helping chain goal n't everyone become professional poppy farmer 's make access opium poppies common enough 'd completely impossible control event 're ever cracked

Overdose or Panic Attack from Methadone?,"About 2 hours ago, I took 80 mg of methadone because I was experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms. I usually use up to 1.5 g of heroin daily and can handle 60 mg of methadone without any issues. Now my head feels incredibly heavy, like a ton, and I feel dizzy whenever I move it. I’m starting to panic, wondering if this could be an overdose. Did anyone ever experience this with methadone? Does an overdose feel similar to other opioids, or could this just be side effects?",2,4,2025-01-26 13:26:02,overdose panic attack methadone 2 hours ago took 80 mg methadone experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms usually use 1.5 g heroin daily handle 60 mg methadone without issues head feels incredibly heavy like ton feel dizzy whenever move ’ starting panic wondering could overdose anyone ever experience methadone overdose feel similar opioids could side effects

Mixing drugs,Recently I’ve wanted to see how Adderall mixed with some downers. Took a 15 mg tablet and some .5 xans. Don’t recommend even tho the feeling was good the Adderall kinda trumps the xanax. Also makes me want to eat them like candy went through 20 .5s in 2 days. Then oxy and Adderall is better than the Xans feeling wise. But overall I’d say just take Adderall by itself and the downers for a comedown. Or a small dose of Adderall ,1,2,2025-01-26 15:57:44,mixing drugs recently ’ wanted see adderall mixed downers took 15 mg tablet .5 xans ’ recommend even tho feeling good adderall kinda trumps xanax also makes want eat like candy went 20 .5s 2 days oxy adderall better xans feeling wise overall ’ say take adderall downers comedown small dose adderall
Does anyone else hallucinate / have vivid lucid dreams while nodding ?,"It’s not from withdrawal or from sleep deprivation, when I really nod, I am in this very realistic dream state, where I am basically sleep walking.

I was walking around the kitchen at home taking orders like I was at work, I yelled for a manager (just at home with my bf,) “watched” my dog play outside while talking to her, (she was not with me at this time) etc. it is so realistic and vivid, not scary or anything just wondering if anyone knows what this is called or if it’s common?",8,18,2025-01-26 04:37:51,anyone else hallucinate vivid lucid dreams nodding ’ withdrawal sleep deprivation really nod realistic dream state basically sleep walking never happened nodded h back day past month ’ happened handful times walking around kitchen home taking orders like work yelled manager home bf “ watched ” dog play outside talking time etc realistic vivid scary anything wondering anyone knows called ’ common
hustles,"what are some quick result hustle ideas that you guys have up your sleeve? when i say quick result i just mean not something that is going to take a long time to get set up before you actually make any money out of it (however if you got something more like that that you think is worth sharing im definitely still willing to hear it) but what im really asking about are hustles that don't require a whole lot of prior prep to be able to pull off & have a pretty quick turn around, im not looking to become rich off of it just something that i can do to make enough money at a time to be able to get what i need to get.

im gonna list a couple of hustles that i have used in the past & that have worked really well for me in order to give a better example of what sort of things im talking about (plus i hate when someone asks for information but isn't willing to share what they know so its also as a sort of good faith effort if you will) 

starting off really simple, there is a place near me that buys gift cards for a % so i would go into a handful of different stores & lift stuff that i could then return without the receipt & get a gift card/store credit for & turn around & sell them to this place. easy. another one that i used for a really really long time is i would pick up receipts from the parking lot (this would work for any store but i found that walmart was the absolute best for multiple different reasons) & then go into the store & lift whatever eas on that receipt then return it using the receipt that i found for cash. this one can be quite affective if you play your card right. then theres the obvious lifting stuff to bring to platos closet/once upon a child/pawn shops. these are all pretty effective & the only reason why they don't work for me anymore as daily hustles is because i have done it so much that it is too risky to go back inside of these stores & attempt to keep doing it right now which is the main reason why im asking what yalls hustles are. ive had a few little hustles here & there of similar difficulty that i could pull off from my phone but none of those are quite as lucrative so basically im just trying to see what i can learn from yall so i can get back to being okay each day ",0,13,2025-01-26 15:08:21,hustles quick result hustle ideas guys sleeve say quick result mean something going take long time get set actually make money however got something like think worth sharing im definitely still willing hear im really asking hustles n't require whole lot prior prep able pull pretty quick turn around im looking become rich something make enough money time able get need get im gon na list couple hustles used past worked really well order give better example sort things im talking plus hate someone asks information n't willing share know also sort good faith effort starting really simple place near buys gift cards would go handful different stores lift stuff could return without receipt get gift card/store credit turn around sell place easy another one used really really long time would pick receipts parking lot would work store found walmart absolute best multiple different reasons go store lift whatever eas receipt return using receipt found cash one quite affective play card right theres obvious lifting stuff bring platos closet/once upon child/pawn shops pretty effective reason n't work anymore daily hustles done much risky go back inside stores attempt keep right main reason im asking yalls hustles ive little hustles similar difficulty could pull phone none quite lucrative basically im trying see learn yall get back okay day

Switching back from IV to sniffing/oral. What worked for you?,"I’m tired of having to exercise and shower in borderline boiling water to make my veins show up in the morning. If I don’t I take 30mins to hit at the very least. Somehow when I pull out the needle, vein blood flows out, so I’m definitely hitting it. However, them veins are so f’d up that when I try to suck blood into the syringe, it doesn’t come.

Anyway, what worked for you to quit the IV ritual? It’s not like it gives me a special high or rush anymore. It’s mostly about the IV itself being encoded in by brain as I bang buprenorphine pills. There used to be an argument that it’s faster this way, but as I said it’s not the case anymore. 

I’m mostly worried about needing more, but the doctor said it will work longer, so it will all even out. I’m obviously scared to try, because being left with no pills 3 days before the refill is a horror and a waste of time.

First time IV. Talk me out of it? Anyone else been using for a long time before they tried IV,"I’ve been on opioids for over a decade. 
Years ago I “tried” to see what IV was like and I used a huge IM needle so predictably it was horrible and I hit a tendon without ever drawing blood. 

Hitting a tendon was enough punishment for me to think “never again” plus not understanding the needle size was a huge factor had me thinking it was awful and my dislike of needles was totally founded in logic about it being painful.

Fast forward to today. I had a random bag of harm reduction supplies I got out of curiosity when I was at an event they were available at. I just drew blood with a 0.5ml insulin syringe with a tiny little needle. It was so easy! Painless, felt like nothing.

Now I’m sitting here thinking “the only thing that kept me from taking this step was wrong, the process IV doesn’t need to be a deterrent in itself.

So now there’s nothing stopping me from crushing up an 8mg dilaudid, filtering it and banging it. I’m curious. I kind of want to. I’ve never even been given IV opioids in the hospital. I wish I had so I could say I’ve tried it without ever doing it myself.

I’m curious(will it feel like the first time I sniffed some? I’ve been staying ok not getting high for awhile so is there any point? At the same time I’m afraid I will lose control if I take this step maybe I can’t put that genie back in the bottle.
I lost control with just snorting pills. It took a long time to admit that but I hardly have control when it comes to opioids. I have a script luckily, but I’m on a self led taper so IV would seem like a step back.

No friends, no family. Any reply is appreciated. 

Stay healthy, cheers!

"If you were a hardcore addict over a year ago, would you feel ANY withdrawals after using Kratom just once? (Placebo?)","Hey guys. This is not me trying to find an excuse to use again, because it already happened. 

Once a while (over a year ago) i swore to never touch pills again and I actually managed to avoid them ever since. I was a hardcore addict eating up to 1 gram of real oxy a day.

Well yesterday my backpain was killing me in the morning (got a new very physical job which I need to get used to first) and I felt like there is no way I can attend my job with such a pain. I used my emergency kratom dose, which I kept in my closet in cases of the cravings or whatever are getting the better of me. But I made sure its only 1 dose and not enough for a second one. 

Well it took away my backpain and gave me a slight energy boost, even tho it was not comparable to the high I got on oxys (maybe its better this way. I shouldn't get that feeling again) 

Now the next day I dont really any noticeable withdrawals. But I dont know something feels off?. Like the very very end phase of PAWS? (Physically). Like there is some kind of weird discomfort barrrrreely noticeable in my head. Its not cravings, I somehow have zero urge to take it right now.

Curious,"I live in the middle of the country. I hear talk of actual tar so dark it's purple running around the streets. I've been clean for almost a year and I'm a House manager at a Sober Living joint. The problem is I hear talk of some real scag on the street. 

I really got the itch guys and gals.  I want to put a spike in my veins and watch that black death push in my system.  

Last time I shot a quarter gram of fatty and all I got was a blackout and some homeless jerk hitting me with narcan to wake me up. Maybe he saved my life...did I ask for that shit? 

So what's the skinny? I have $25 bucks. I might throw away a whole years progress, my own room, potential upward movement for JUST ONE FIX. 

Wouldn't you?  

We got no future but war boys and girls. Our homeland hates us and wants us dead. Our healthcare system is broken and soon Androids will be taking over our lively hood. 

I just want one good shot.  A nice warm feeling for 6-8 hours.  
So what's the skinny?! Is there any H to be had in the mountains of middle America.

"Nac, omeprazole, Benadryl, Tagamet, potentiate","
I use oxycodone mainly I get a lot of percs. Naturally they come with apap which is complete ass. I don’t really have a safe space to do. The whole cwe extract process. 

Anyways this last script I decided to try these for some potentiate. I would usually take the nac once a day for apap safety. The rest I would take a pill of each two or three times a day. I noticed it actually made it incredibly hard to get to nodding territory. I thought it was just my tolerance. The second to last day of my binge. I said fuck it and didn’t want to potentiate. Holy shit I nodded off like half the amount. I instantly got sick as hell though. I don’t know if my nod was from me getting sick or what very confused on that part.

I feel like taking this plethora of drugs on top of the oxy. Made my high feel even more clean than usual. I had incredible euphoria but less sedative. I feel like It kept my head on straighter. Not as much slurring my words or zoning out at work. Which actually made it pretty nice. I don’t know which one helped so much with nausea. Usually since I’m taking so much apap. I get very nauseous if I over do it that day or go too many days. Without taking a break for my liver. This was an added plus, I think it was either the nac or Benadryl. That mainly helped with that. I would say taking these was about 6’s. I don’t feel like it made my high stronger or last longer. I feel like it just made it feel a lot less sedative and more head rush. I didn’t get nearly as sick or dumbed out though. 

If anyone else has experience taking any of these drugs with oxy. Please let me know. I want to kinda fine tune the process. Maybe get it so I still nod as often without puking. Maybe figuring out what made me nod less and take that during the day. Then at night lay off it so I can nod hard. 

For anyone just wondering about using nac for helping with apap. I feel like it made a major difference. Everyday I took the nac in the morning. I felt like I wasn’t killing my liver and getting ulcers. I would 100% recommend using it to help with apap.

Boofed morphine not working that well. Advice?,"In the past hour I've boofed 60mg of morphine. Pretty sure I've done everything correctly. My method:

- Scraped off the coating and crushed up 4 15mg morphine ER pills
- Dissolved each 15mg in about 2-3mL of warm water
- Inserted oral syringe about an inch deep in my ass laying down and standing up (I did this last night, too, but went deeper and thought I went too deep so I went a little less deep this time)
- Pushed the plunger over the course of about 5-10 seconds
- Laid down on my side for 5-10 minutes after each time

I feel the effects but not very strong at all. 

I HAVE been using kratom daily for the past few months but I've only been using 2g or even less per day for the most part and my tolerance to kratom seems pretty similar to when I started using kratom. And I took a 48 hour break before using morphine. I used to use oxy and hydrocodone before kratom and my typical doses were 20mg oxy or 30-40mg of hydrocodone, but I only used once a week max.

Is my tolerance just that high from kratom, or is there some other issue I'm not seeing? I'm just surprised that it would have this much of a dulling effect. I am on SSRIs but haven't had any problems with opioids being dulled before while on them other than this morphine.",1,7,2025-01-26 03:05:52,boofed morphine working well advice past hour 've boofed 60mg morphine pretty sure 've done everything correctly method scraped coating crushed 4 15mg morphine er pills dissolved 15mg 2-3ml warm water inserted oral syringe inch deep ass laying standing last night went deeper thought went deep went little less deep time pushed plunger course 5-10 seconds laid side 5-10 minutes time feel effects strong using kratom daily past months 've using 2g even less per day part tolerance kratom seems pretty similar started using kratom took 48 hour break using morphine used use oxy hydrocodone kratom typical doses 20mg oxy 30-40mg hydrocodone used week max tolerance high kratom issue 'm seeing 'm surprised would much dulling effect ssris n't problems opioids dulled morphine

Hyrdomorphone,"So I snorted 4mg last night felt great no itchiness tho. About 30 minutes ago I railed another 4mg. Most time I take opioids or opiates I get extremely itchy this time I don’t. This is my first time I’ve ever had hydromorphone I know they are legit I tested them. Could I force myself to be itchy I really enjoy it and it helps me gauge how long and how high I am! 

I cannot boof or IV them and i understand oral is basically a waste. So snorting is my only option I have the tiny orange P 2 pills. They are on my account if you aren’t sure what I’m talking about, is there anything about these pills I need to know. Google says Purdue pharma makes them and another says amneal? So I don’t know it would be much appreciated if someone could lmk who actually makes these pills. Anyways just wanted to post about this and make a lil trip report.

I feel very relaxed and slight euphoria and a very mild warmth pulsing through my body. No nodding or respiratory depressions I actually feel quite alert as well. I’m not naive to pain pills and I think this is definitely gonna take the cake for the best high

Manage opioid withdrawal,"I just wanna say what I’ve found helpful going through withdrawal hundreds of times. This is my experience and what helps.

1) Kratom is the only thing I’ve found that helps with withdrawal, that’s not a script. I take 6-7 grams in morning and 2-3 grams after whenever I feel like I’m having a hard time. I’m not suggesting anyone take this much I’m 250lbs. Imodium is great for diarrhea but if I take enough kratom I don’t really have diarrhea. 
I CANT stomach plain leaf, it’s disgusting, I do capsules. Usually 2 capsules is a gram. 
2) One if not the most annoying things in WD is the cold sweats. It’s only till recently I’ve figured how to manage this.
Your body starts sweating this junk out. So if you sweat more, it goes away for a bit.
I take a hot shower or bath, hot as I can take it.
I’ve done it 5 times in a day and I feel stupid I didn’t realize this sooner. IT DOESNT matter if it’s 2 am and you just sweat through a shirt. Go sweat it out and you will relax!
3) if you have access to music relaxers or benzo to sleep it helps.
4) KEEP your mind BUSY. Times gonna drag. Force yourself to read or watch tv if you gotta.
5) eat well and drink a lot of water and salt(Celtic or pink Himalayan)Lemon and lime help
6) Rotate NSAIDs. Ibuprofen and Tylenol when u feel worst!

Alternate dimension/remote viewing experience,"Hey all, 

I just want to share an experience.

First off about me, I am new to any opiates experiences. I’m more of an upper kind of person and have never dabbled with downs unless it’s that super indica strains being grown these days.

Anyway, this past spring I became terribly ill and suffered a ruptured appendix and a portion of my large intestine. I didn’t know this at the time and passed the pain off as a major stomach upset and drank pepto (LOL) When I finally couldn’t take the pain (48hrs of pain baby pain) I called up an ambulance and got a ride to the hospital and sort it out. Long story short my injuries were so severe that I had leaked nasty juices from my intestine on to my abdominal cavity infecting everything it touched thus guaranteeing an overstay at my local hospital. The surgeon usually send patients home after a quick surgery. The infected regions of my abdomen was on fire with pain along with my stitches being stretched due to my stomach being distended from the trauma it just went through, This is where I asked my nurse for anything to help with the pain and I was expecting a strong Tylenol or anesthesia LOL. She snickered and suggested to give me some hydromorphs/dilaudid. Me being naive replied sure just give me like 10 of those bad boys and call it a night. She leaves and comes back with a variety of IV fluids and I was surprised because I wasn’t ready for all of that but the pain made me feel otherwise. First IV fluid was gravol, disgusting, tasted like plastic which was weird because I didn’t drink it and made me extremely nauseous. The second bag of IV fluid was the main course as I’d like to call
It during my stay LOL an IV of dilaudid, now I know  now that what the hospital gives patients are watered down but I am new to this and BOY did that bag of goodness took the pain away and put me to sleep and I liked it, until the IV ran out and then I’m violently shocked back in to pain and to make it worse the gravol is still in effect and made the room spin inducing projectile vomiting of fluid and bile. Oh the deep green funky smell of bile filling the room is unforgettable. I stayed a total of 7 days and was under dilaudid atleast 5 of those days. I’d take it once in the morning after I woke up after “breakfast” (I couldn’t eat anything solid so water was breakfast) and then if I was lucky or looked like in pain enough then twice in the evening leaving me in my dreams of lucidity.

The experience. On my 3rd/4th night feeling real sick and tired of being sick and tired, I had asked my nurse for my nightly dose of dilaudid and she hooked it up and as I wait for the warm embrace of not feeling anything, the last thought on my mind lingered on the last thing I was watching on YouTube, Dreams or alternate dimensions. As I sat on my bed, pain slowly going, I suddenly found myself in a different location. I was surrounded
By family and friends in a different country around a bonfire during a feast, what a weird dream I thought to myself and then I looked around I was suddenly transported back to my hospital room. The experience was surreal so I let myself get taken over because what the hell. So I instantly go back to that location again and realized I’m seeing this whole thing from what felt like another person point of view and I didn’t mind it but every now and then I would be thrusted back in to myself and be a little confused and eventually I was in both reality were I’m seeing the strangers POV while the hospitals background noises where being heard simultaneously or the weirdest visual I saw was I’m seeing the strangers POV and my hospital room at the same time. As I stayed in my strangers POV I came to realize that I was the patriarch of the family/village and was at the end of my life and the family and friends threw a feast to celebrate, they gathered around me told stories spoke in a strange languages and gave their best wishes. The cool thing was I had memories or what felt like memories of that life. I had children and scars and stories. I felt happy with content and it made me tear up knowing I lived a good life and just as I thought that I was back in my room, violently thrusted back in to my reality, confused looking for my strange family and in pain once again. Projectile vomiting and that cold, white sterile room alone. I asked for another dose of dilaudid but I had used up my max allowed ration for that night and was shit out of luck for a few hours. As I laid there in pain and sorrow, smell of bile lingered I thought about my alternate life and that episode of Rick and Morty. Wondering.

Next couple of days, I’ve come to conclusion that dilaudid dreams are a mind fuck but a welcome experience on perspective and I was glad I experienced it. Being on IV was hindering my recovery so I decided to get off the IV fluid and the darnedest thing happened. Inflammation from surgery subsided, nausea went away and infected area started healing itself.

First time oxycodone.,"I’ve never been interested in recreational opiates, seeing the impact it can cause firsthand. 
I have a script for migraine headaches that have 30mg codeine and paracetamol so I know the opiate warm fuzzies when I take 2 for a bad migraine. 

I broke my elbow 2 days ago and was given 10x5mg oxy. Well it definitely helps with the pain, as intended. Taken 5mg at midday and another 5mg 6 hours later, got the warm relaxation and bit of euphoria but not overwhelming. 

It is quite nice to relax with the pain management, and to be able to experience what a “proper” opiate is thought a legitimate source. 

The country I live in is very tight on opiate regulation so I don’t see any opportunity to acquire this medication again, which is completely fine. I do however see how fantastical it could be to have more access to it and for higher doses. Even at a therapeutic dose it does feel somewhat moreish.

What happened that night to me?,"I know it was probably an overdose but has anyone experienced this? Roughly 4 years ago before I got clean I took a shot of dope and went to sleep. I ended up waking up feeling like my insides were on fire and I couldn't breathe at all. My right arm was essentially a noodle,no control at all, I panicked after close to over a minute of not breathing so I started forcing my other hand down my throat and eventually bright orange,hard and massive vomit started coming out of me, nothing I've ever seen before.

Every so often I could catch a small short breath. This happened for maybe 5 minutes I'm not sure exactly how long. I could only take maybe one breath every so often and kept throwing up this hard orange material that would only come out of me very slowly I thought I was going to suffocate. After several minutes I was finally able to regain function in my right arm and breath normally.

Being sober now since 2021 I still think about that night. Anyone experience something similar?",3,3,2025-01-25 05:02:54,happened night know probably overdose anyone experienced roughly 4 years ago got clean took shot dope went sleep ended waking feeling like insides fire could n't breathe right arm essentially noodle control panicked close minute breathing started forcing hand throat eventually bright orange hard massive vomit started coming nothing 've ever seen every often could catch small short breath happened maybe 5 minutes 'm sure exactly long could take maybe one breath every often kept throwing hard orange material would come slowly thought going suffocate several minutes finally able regain function right arm breath normally sober since 2021 still think night anyone experience something similar

"detoxed in August for 30 days, started the rodeo all over again. Need some advice?","Canadian here. 
So I’m currently knee deep in the hydro / dills again. 
almost been 4 months of daily use. 
On the low end 40mg, most days 64-80mg. 
my tolerance is into oblivion, if I could afford it I could do 160mg a day no problem. 

My question is…. Would I be better off tapering my dose to mitigate withdrawals? Or go cold turkey and just suffer through it? 

My only issue with CT is…. I live with family and they are aware of my past issues with drugs, I just got a job in my dream field of work, and I cannot afford to bed rot for 7-10 days….

Also, I don’t have comfort meds like I did when I detoxed in August. I tend to struggle hard core with insomnia and RLS.

Nitazene discussion! We need all the insight possible!,"Okay everyone, this is clearly taking off and not many know what is going on. There is a new class of opioid agonists out there on the streets being cut into products known as “nitazines” and they are seemingly dangerous. I remember when fentanyl hit the streets the media made it out to be way worse than it really was. Yes, fentanyl is bad, yes it is strong, but it’s not that scary because it’s less of an RC therefore experienced users could read up and find better understanding. The nitazines however are hard to find information on, so that’s the reason for this thread. Any information you may have please listen to here.

Supposed to be on suboxone but I cant stop using,"Hello everyone, 

It's going to be a bit of a long one... but I wanted to share my story, not sure why, maybe therapeutic reasons.

I started taking opiates when I was 14, started with Dilaudid and hydromorphone, I was in an accidentand have 3 herniated discs which I wasn't being treated for and I found a way to help ease my pain but it changed my life. At 17 I went to a methadone clinic and started on methadone treatment and continued doing that for about 9 years, constantly going in the wrong direction raising my dose to treat pain instead of lowering it. I eventually got a job  one where I'm very successful and I had an opportunity to go to Sweden with other people who were the best in our industry and I couldn't because of my methadone, not to mention the severe depression i felt it was causing. So I made the Jump to suboxone because I was tired of methadone, It was 6 weeks of hell, I ended up on 18mg of suboxone, due to the withdrawals from the methadone and suboxone mixing I started using again, I was taking upwards to 180mg of hydromorphone contin via IV a day, once fully on the suboxone I realized it was not nearly enough to treat my pain. My doctor referred me to another suboxone doctor that prescribes Me 18mg hydromorphone contin 2 times a day and I get a weeks worth.

I just can't stop using them via IV and I'm taking double or triple what's prescribed. I stop my suboxone for 3 days at a time using hydros to stop withdrawals... in the 3rd day at about 72 hours since last dose I take a big shot, and then a few hours later take 32mg suboxone to re induce with what ever little bit of suboxone I still have left in my system. the money im spending is ridiculous, and I can't keep this up, last time I hit 3 days I was seriously considering just stopping the suboxone, and at that point I would just spiral out of control even more than I already have. I'm starting to perform poorly at my job which made me 200k last year, my family life is taking a hit to with Me.just spending hours hidden  in the bathroom after work, financially I'm spending over 1500/month on extra meds. All for a nod. 

I'm not sure what to do, I'm not sure how to break this cycle. I feel like my family would be better off If I were gone, my life insurance being more valuable than my life. I consistently tell Myself tomorrow I'm starting my suboxone and staying on it for good, and I never do.

Advice after relapsing,"I relapsed around 6 weeks ago on heroin unfortunately…And due to being on buprenorphine prior to my relapse its obviously bumped up my tolerance.

If I’m honest I barely even feel euphoria I just nod. Is this because of the bup? 

I’ve just moved down to oxy, I have 6x 80mg Oxylan’s which I’ll probs take all over the next couple days, then go back to buprenorphine after obviously avoiding PWD. How long will it take me to stabilize on buprenorphine?

Possibly the last time I’ll get high.,"So I’ve been a long time user for like 10 years or more I started with perc 30s and the went to the fent/heroin. In all this time I’ve never real had clean time for more than a few days and that wasnt usually my choice. Well anyway to try and make this story as short as I can in October my guy who was always really good started getting absolutely dogshit. And my brother , my really good friend and I who we all went to the same 2 people ( who both got from the same guy) started going through hell so we all decided to finally quit. My brother and I who have the same job and both share an apartment ( I know that’s crazy lol) quit our jobs ( with financial help from our parents) and our buddy went and got help through his family . We all went on methadone and it’s been going GREAT. Literally the best it’s ever been. I went from doing 5 grams a day to like 2 grams to one gram to NOTHING but the methadone. I’ve been at the nothing stage for like 2 weeks cause the last time I bought was 1/6 and before that it was like even a week before that ( I caved when I got that call from the 🔌 saying he got the 🔥 🤦🏼‍♂️) ok sorry I know I’m dragging this out let me get to the point. Between the time I actually started getting methadone and the time my 🔌 got the 💩 was like a month and I bought so much caca and my bro and I would get like 5-10 grams at a time. So once it was bad it would go away in a drawer and we’d go and get more so that left us with a lot of shit left over. I was always a smoker but i realized if I snorted it instead it was actually a lot better so we ended up going through all the caca too a while ago. Except for 2 bags. One bag I’ve had out for a while and like every couple days I’d do a line and I felt very little to nothing . Then today I tried the other bag. It got me like 🤤 lol. I live in a different city than my 🔌 and I have no car I owe him money and Im jobless and broke but most importantly I am 💯 committed to staying on the right path. Once I’m out of what I have I’m not getting more. Hopefully forever. But at least a real long time my future is actually looking good for once. I have many opportunities that I will fuck up if I go back. Im 35 and truthfully have had more help from my parents and grandparents than I’d like to admit and as I’m getting older and they are too I know they won’t be there forever so it’s time to grow up. But I can’t bring myself to throw this in the 🚽. So this going to be last high…… I hope

how hard will my tapering /wds feel,"Hi,

I’m considering pausing my oxycodone IR treatment for a while and resuming later. I’ve been using it for chronic pain and have taken more than my prescribed dose over the past 40 days due to pain flare-ups. My usual dose has been 15–20 mg daily for a year, but I had to get an extra box from the pharmacy, which raised some concerns. To avoid any further issues, I want to taper down, make up for the extra pills I’ve used, and then resume once I’m back on track. I’d appreciate feedback on my tapering plan and whether it looks okay.

Here’s what I’ve been doing:

**1 month before tapering**: I started taking 5–10 mg at 16:00 and 15 mg at 24:00 daily.

**Days 1,2,4,5,6**: Switched to a single 15 mg dose every 24 hours (my initial treatment dose). Days 1 and 2 were rough, but by Day 4 to 6, I no longer experienced night sweats or cravings.

**Days 7, 8, 9** : taking 10 mg every 24 hours.(i'm currently on Day 7, still have not taken the 10mg dose)

**Days 10, 11**:  7.5 mg every 24 hours.

**Days 13, 14**:  5 mg every 24 hours.

does this sound okay? will the wds be severe? would like to know your opinion and recomendations please, i have no confort meds aside from  doxylamine for sleep

After this taper, I plan to take a 10-day break to reset my tolerance and then resume treatment at the prescribed dose.

How strong is O-dsmt? What are the effects of too much NRI?,"I'm in Europe and O-dsmt recently was added to my RC connects his products you can get. I was wondering if anyone got the rough potency of O-dsmt? And what too much NRI can do to you (incase of high doses)?

Reason I wonder is because (wont tell my entire story, it's too long but feel free to ask questionsif you want to know smth), anyway reason is due to my insane oxycodone habit where I got addicted to Mundipharma OxyContin (OC formula), and also the generic OC versions, hydromorphone, 200mg morphine pills. 

Sorry if the posts gets a bit long, not only wanted to ask about O-dsmt relative effects. As this is one of the chillest subs to talk to people since every single soul here has an entire story to tell and been through something, my post is long because on top of asking my initial question maybe it stimulates conversation about some other shit too.

I also wanted to explain some of my story so I could deduce if it'd have any point at all as I'm on 100mg methadone currently and I double dipped once like 4 months ago and so this means I miss a day (luckily my prescription is written in a special way, like when I had to go daily I would always get my bottle for the next day, so I never have to facedose. I just have to go to the pharmacy 3 times on account my dose being high (Europe so heroin is still the big dog here and 100mg basically prevents heroin euphoria).

Never got up to using a needle, vowed I'd never snort when I was still a 20 year old kid and had this secret pride that I was the only one left of my friendgroups of drug users (my old cannabis mates of whom nobody struggles with opiate addiction, they all struggle with stim addiction or ket addiction and benzo addiction (a lot of the benzo addictions around are partially due to me dumping a lot of them here for ""cheap"" back in 2019. 

You only had 2 other people selling xanax in my town at the time, the one guy always bought 10 generic alprazolam boxes from a city 5 hours away and charged 120 euro for them, the other skimmed off his dads pharmacy, needless to say, his dad told the police it was his son as he found out through cameras and didn't want to lose his pharmacy. My country only has what the US refers to as ""mom and pop pharmacies"", we have no ""giants"".

The plug we miraculasouly find who skimmed off his place of work(not a pharmacy, but medicine delivery, when our plug heard pallettes of medicine go missing sometime or medicines breaks and gets tossed out; they had a system meant to prevent skimming but there was an easy workaround apparently (this is all just what my plug told me in 2019, then he made my offer that each EG box of benzos (60pills per box) would cost 30 per, and liquid clonazepam drips only 5 euros (drips sold for 175 euros without fail, reason? you could put it in a fucking soda). 

Anyway shit was heaven, made so much money from this new business, we were the only people in town now with benzos although some guy that was a belgian but raised in the UK, so he was basically english, he had 4 doctors and a mind for business but most importantly: he gets prescribed opiates for his conditions, getting opiates here at a young age is HARD as fuck, you're lucky to get tramadol to take home after a hospital stay from a heavy surgery;. It's wicked how this dude was getting 20mg oxycontins, tussethyl (ethylmorphine), paracodine (dihydrocodeine) and he traded me them with benzos because he wanted money and sell benzos. 

It was a genius arrangement and the start of my increasingly frequent opiate use as before this it was only benzos and 3 paracodines a month, one trade with this guy and he gave me 3 bottles of the extinct tussethyl, 3 bottles of paracodine, 2 boxes of 20mg oxycontin. I asked about his pain and he just said ""ibuprofen works fine and they also prescribed a 0.8mg/1ml codeine syrup that helps the coughing. (he was getting overprescribed obviously and also doctorshopping to get so much at once).

I was 19-20 back then and most of my profit went to either oxies or paracodine/tussethyl as I had been on opiates casually since I was 17, I had found an oxycontin 20mg blister on the ground with 1 pill left walking to work, my job was picking up trash so looking at the ground spotting stuff was a mastered skill. I knew you could get high of it, and had to make it instant release, I also knew heroin was an opioid but dumb teenager me thought heroins reputation comes from it being a streetdrug, I only trusted pharmaceuticals, so I figured I was good for any of the bad shit they said but my dumbass didn't get withdrawals untill I bought 40p at once and experiences it from using 30 days. All my casual binges were either during the month with long enough breask inbetween 2 day binges that WD was never noticeable, I had all the benzos I wanted in house and used to take 30mg xanax to wake up, and then redose every 2-3h with the equivalent of 6-20mg xanax or clonazepam in all sorts of benzos, at the same I was also taking the traded oxies and the syrups the UK dude would get me. Still I didn't expect shit t o get too bad, I just was still generally ignorant to drugs side effects as I prided myself for never having done any ""dope"".

(dope is slang for any harder drug than weed basically, the term is mainly used by ravers when talking about their drugs coz of their polydrug use at festivals and so forth, and dope around our town are drugs like the following: ketamine, mdma, amphetamines,2cb, cocaine, 3-mmc or 4-mmc, etc..)

NOTE: An opioid epidemic had never happened here in western europe where I live, the drugs that hit the news where either NPS or crack since our country is built on cocaine, heroin at high purity levels of 60% or more is common (#3) but only in the cities, so where I love nobody knew wtf opiates were and what kinda heavenly high it created (so opiate use is very low, of all my friends I am the only one that went so far and got to 1,2g oxy daily for months, I was spiraling out of control because the fiending right after snorting a dose because it wasn't making me high enough anymore to be as energetic and productive and talkative as I used to be or the drug had simply betrayed me like so many others. (it was the dissease getting worse) 

At this stage many try needles and heroin as it's more potent than oxycodone (especially the needle part, even injected morphine can't be topped by oxycodone despite high oral BA and being stronger) - but and this is no offense to any needle users, I didn't want to end down that path of becoming a full blown junkie, but this last sentence contradicts my thinking today, as I was a full blown junkie. I just kepy my morals and never stole from family or any shit like that, I did get my money not by being nice, I probably ended up scamming many people, even IRL like having my oxyplug (who was a friend and gave me them for 50 euros per box of 60x80mgs), getting them this cheap also quickly raised my use and tolerance so much as opposed to paying 4x that for 4x less (used to pay 200 for 30x40mg OCs, then this 18 year old kid comes with a method in his province to have the ability to get atleast 4 boxes of 60x80mg oxy without raising alarms (so 4,8grams per box I was getting).

When my habit got so out of control 4 boxes of 4,8grams didn't even cover the month anymore, a box lasted me 5 days if lucky. I had become a full blown junkie, I had realized after my first WD that it doesnt matter whether you IV or take pills, we all end up kicking or legs whilst freezing cold and sweating thinking of ending it atleast every WD we go through. When my WDs were manageable with taking 40mg xanax a day (this was when my oxy habit was ""only"" 120mg a day), having my benzo tolerance cursed me in terms of comfort meds. The only miracle comfort med for me was lyrica (never had been able to get clonidine as it's not used here), nobody sold lyrica either, it has become a popular drug last year but not where I live, in the capital city it has become an issue under homeless folks. 

But still, no plug was selling lyrica, I used the onions for it once and my post accute WD suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety almost fully dissapeared and I was happy on lyrica after a forced detox of 14 days, obviously once my plug sent he finally had a box on the 13th day clean I relapsed, but this time I relapsed with a dual habit to lyrica. Lyrica WDs the only ones I ignored the warnings off, I've seen my brother seize and almost die of xans as it lasted long before the paramedics came, I know my uncle gave up on life with a shotgun because of alcohol and his brain being fucked from no sleep due to speed abuse and the damage 90s psychiatric theories caused people, loading them up with all kinds of drugs for serotonin saying the issue was that he has ""too little serotonin"", an idea of the cause of depression. That hypothesis of serotonin has been called out for being bullshit as a cause of depression 2 years ago.

This brings me to where I am, so I've been on MAT for 2 years (methadone), it's been mostly good. I am on 100mg, I have no cravings, I do not feel 800mg oxycodone, I don't want to feel high again but I just took it for my big day in court 3 months after being on MAT so I just needed to snort oxy to get through that, placebo helped that day. Anyway I cba to spend 300 and eat 30x80mgs at once to possibly have the energetic oxy feeling that I love, I'll most likely die before achieving that. Only way to do it would be to go off methadone although no idea how long it takes for tolerance to reset off methadone, off oxy it was like 2 weeks for me for 80% reset.

I was force withdrawaled off 100mg methadone for 8 long days that I still remember. To make matters worse they even changed my meds from my 6mg xanax/day that I've been used to for almost a decade and instead gave me 3x5mg tranxene, then 3x15 when I complained, (15mg tranxene is 0.5mg xanax), so RLS was insane and for the rest it's weird, every day smth else starts and slowly worsens, day 3 few sneezes, day 4 sneezing fits, loose bowels from day 3 but not runs like from oxy or heroin wd, it's like a slow torturous method because everythings mild until in the 2nd week except the freezing cold and RLS and insomnia are there immediatly at the max, probably was my enormous lyrica habit WDs too though.

Being on MAT been good, 2 years clean, I did double dip once and even though I don't gotta facedose and have a daily dose still because of the arrangement with my doctor, I just miss a dose as I'm supposed to have dosed at home on pickup day but I drank that bottle few months ago.

So was curious how effective O dsmt can be, perhaps I can go a week on 30-50mg and save up a weeks worth of methadone for any emergency scenario.

TLDR: how strong is o-dsmt;what happens when you take too many NRI's?;would a high enough dose with lyrica and benzos take care of methadone WD mostly? Or cant you high dose it cause of NRI?

Oxy addict hoping someone can help me workout a taper plan with Suboxone,"Hey y’all. I finally was able to find a suboxone strip in my city, obviously not through Reddit.

I wake up just on the edge of withdrawal, I try to push my doses as late as I can bear before the sweats and everything come on. 

Can somebody please explain how to use the sub to taper? And what other concerns to look out for when using subs? Is there risk of PWD with oxy?

Week to recover,"If you were:

🔘Physically and emotionally exhausted (from stress, illness, trauma, etc.),

🔘Out of “spoons” (no energy or life left in you),
…and had just one week to recover, rest, and reset before returning to an intense schedule (like studying or a busy daily life):

⁉️⁉️⁉️What would you do to recover as much as possible in that week? Where would you be? What activities or strategies would help you the most?

My situation (for context): I have next week off from university but will return to an intense academic load afterward.

I’m dealing with:

🔘Recent medical trauma & burnout,

🔘Chronic illness,

🔘ADHD (medicated) and ASD,

🔘Fresh recovery (few weeks) after 5 years of prescription opiate addiction (my brain is still adjusting to life without it). I’m on 50 mg naltrexone. 

🔘I feel extremely drained: even small tasks, like quick grocery shopping, cause shutdown. After quitting opiates I also feel empty, depressed. 

Academic achievements are my number one priority and I’m aiming for highest grades again, but I’m struggling to find energy or focus.

I know that true recovery takes much longer than a week, and there are no quick fixes. But life doesn’t always allow for extended breaks, so I’m desperate for any tips that might help.

Heroin cut with possibly coffee creamer?,Just trying to see I am a recreational heroin smoker- I know it’s mostly fentanyl and Xylazine but either way I go to the same person usually always have the same quality but today I went to smoke it and it was bubbling up with a whiteish color (the product is purple and burns into a green/blue) and instantly burning and charred up… the only time I’ve ever seen something like this was a few years back I was a dummy and took more than half the supply I was splitting with my partner and to try to cover it up I added the tiniest bit of dry coffee creamer and ruined the whole batch and it did this- is there a way to separate the dope from the cut or am I better off just sniffing the remainder that I have left? ,0,2,2025-01-24 00:13:42,heroin cut possibly coffee creamer trying see recreational heroin smoker- know ’ mostly fentanyl xylazine either way go person usually always quality today went smoke bubbling whiteish color product purple burns green/blue instantly burning charred up… time ’ ever seen something like years back dummy took half supply splitting partner try cover added tiniest bit dry coffee creamer ruined whole batch this- way separate dope cut better sniffing remainder left

I know it’s not a tolerance issue because if I take the same exact amount or even LESS on a work day it hits so strong. Same thing with kratom. What is this about?

112 days,"hey guys i’m officially 112 days clean. this sub helped me so much. thank you guys so much. i just started college too. ready for this next chapter of my life. 

i kicked my fentanyl habit. i was taking 15 dirty 30s a day alongside occasional oxy and morphine. i quit cold turkey and it was hell but on my 2nd week i used 7oh and it was so good for the mental. now i’m preparing to cold turkey the 7oh. 

i just needed to thank this sub. i wanted to get it off my chest too because i can’t really talk about this stuff to anyone around me i always get judged and belittled. people act like quitting drugs is easy and im making too much of it. they tell me its my own choice and i just “stopped”. 

but everyone here knows how it is. it’s hell but it’s so worth it. life feels more free. i’m not trapped anymore waiting for my next high or waking up sick anymore. i’m ready for college now. i’m about to start my 20s drug free. 

if you’re thinking about quitting. quit. it’ll suck at first but it’ll be so worth it in the end. you got it. and this sub is always here for you. thank god for you guys the wd was so much easier. 

and oh my god the money i’ve saved. is sooo good lol. i’ve saved around $5000 so far without buying drugs. i only spent around $250-450 a month on 7oh and im currently on my taper down to making it only $200 a month. it feels so good to be able to buy things for myself now and not just go spend like $400 a week on drugs. and on some crazier weeks id be spending like $1000.

I can't stop thinking about it.,"I haven't used since Friday, September 13th of last year. 

My boyfriend thinks I used and probably is never coming back. I actually didn't. I just didn't want him to go through my phone.... so he said I'm using. I just like my privacy and felt it was invasive, when I haven't actually done anything wrong. It doesn't even matter. It's over. 

It really feels like, ""welp, while I'm already sinking, I might as well not feel it"".

Now I just need to figure out how to get it now. 

Fuck.

"Boyfriend hid opioids use, what to do/think?","Hi everyone, this isn’t my usual scene or sub, but I’m here seeking advice. I don’t know what to do or what to believe anymore.

My boyfriend is a former addict who quit drugs (primarily opioids, which he used daily) cold turkey 7–8 years ago, enduring all the horrible withdrawal symptoms. He claimed not to have touched anything since.

For the past few months, I’ve had a feeling that something was off, and I asked him a few times if he had started using again. He denied it every time. However, yesterday, I found undeniable proof that he’s been using opioids again (and possibly benzos, weed, and ketamine). He admitted to it.

The general narrative about people hiding their use or addiction is that they will lie repeatedly to cover it up. My trust in him is completely shattered. Drugs are something I’ve never been around—my closest experience is being asked by the random neighborhood dealer if I wanted weed. I’ve always been wary and cautious around people with a history of drug use or abuse, since this is what society tells us. Should I challenge this believe or it is so strong for a reason?

Drug use is a dealbreaker for me, especially since he lied to me about it. But does it have to be? Do people who use or abuse drugs always lie? Is this always tied to an underlying serious mental health issue?

Please share your thoughts... this feels surreal  
  
**^(EDIT: thank you everyone for the comments and your time, this really helped me. For new commenters, since people keep commenting this:)** 

^(-) **^(We have talked)**^(, I didn't come on here to solve my issue with him, but rather to read what people, who are more familiar with addiction/use than me, think about these situations.)

^(-) **^(He does not fully know why he relapsed)**^(. He hated the apartment he lives in and that was a factor in his opinion. Personally I believe that him going back to places where he lived his addiction 7-10 years ago, such as punk concerts/anarchy meet ups and that sort of thing, lead him back to using.)

^(-) **^(I didn't come at him with anger)**^(. I am not angry, I am shocked, sad and disappointed. Being mad won't do us any use just create more issues.)

^(-) **^(This is not the first time he has lied to me)**^(. This is why I consider it a big deal. He has done shit before, has lied to me about it about 3 time and I stayed with him regardless.) 

^(-) **^(He is willing to go back to therapy and wants to get clean for my/our sake)**^(. Now, because he has lied before, I mistrust him when it comes to promises regarding the future)

Please try to be kind I just want to get clean but finding it impossible due to my circumstances...,"So my situation is this I was put on pain meds after a car accident and have been on Dihydrocodeine for almost 10 years however around 5 years ago (before I knew what addiction was) I went to my doctor to ask why I become violently ill if I don't take them and he instantly freaked out, called me an addict then cut me off so I had to start buying online which I never thought I'd do but I'd broken my back and it's led to chronic pain so I was in no place to go cold turkey and still aren't because basically I was moved out for a decade but after my 7 year relationship ended I had to move back home with my abusive father, my older more favoured brother who's never even attempted to move out but receives nothing but respect and kindness from my mum and dad. My mum just allows the mental, verbal and sometimes physical abuse to happen.

I have tried to explain to them that for me to get clean and make it through the hell that is opiate withdrawal it takes alot of mental strength and support from loved ones to make it through and just now I again reminded them of that fact only for my dad to shout at me that I'm a waste of space and they aren't doing anything to stop my detox plans...

How can I go through withdrawals while not being allowed to rest in peace or receive 0 help and support whatsoever in such a toxic environment? Last time I tried I attempted suicide by hanging February 10th last year and you'd think that would give them some idea how dire my mental state is yet here we are almost a year to the date and I am once again extremely suicidal...

I wish i was well enough mentally and physically to get a decent paying job to get the hell away from these monsters.

Also I'd like to add I've never lied, cheated, stolen or allowed my addiction to impact their lives in any way but I am their personal daily dog walker, sitter and house sitter when they go on holiday and despite paying them rent every month I'm not even allowed to use the electricity yet everytime my dad gets a high energy bill he balmes it on me. My brother is not only older than me, rich enough to move out, drives an Audi, has his own espresso machine, mini fridge, two tvs, 2 computers in his room and a vile personality to boot he somehow gets 0 pressure to move out or abuse from my parents and has been the favourite my whole life.
At 13 I was sexually abused by my parents friends son in his bedroom where they would leave me with to go get drunk downstairs with the dad every weekend, I've been in 2 major car accidents neither of which were my fault one at 15 the other at 17 and they said ""well you should of used your brain you can't blame us for your retarded life choices"".

I feel totally helpless, alone, worthless, suicidal, powerless and spend alot of time self loathing...

Sobriety and Work,"So I've been working for an Amazon DSP for almost, if not 2 years straight now. Worked myself right out of homelessness, using the drug program resources as a catalyst to do so.

I had to leave my long term program once I got a job at FedEx in the warehouse while doing uber eats, but it was too much. I was using a rental to live in and do UE until I saved enough to payback the money, but luckily my mother let me use the money to get my own car 

I then used that newly purchased used car to live in and work, this time at a DSP for Amazon. All sounds great right? However in the process I was getting high with a girl I fell for in the program. At the time it felt like I needed all this to keep me sane and okay while living the way I was and too work hard as possible so I wouldn't fail.

Long story short, it's 2 years later and I've been Up and Down tolerance wise but never sober more than maybe 8-10 hours and always doing at least 2-3 bags a day of fet.

This last week I really got into it with my family, it really hit me at my core and made me realize how badly I want to be normal and sober. I'm just tired of not being myself and not being present for every moment of life. It feels like I was in a walking coma for 2 years, and because I drive for a living I can't a stomach I putting any lives at risk, including my own.

This last week has been he'll but everyday I've been doing the tiniest bumps imaginable to stave off withdrawal while trying to prep my mind and body for a full withdrawal. 

What do you guys honestly think? Should I just keep prepping and take a LOA as soon as humanely possible? I was gonna wait until my lease was up, but now I'm considering taking a month maybe a month and half off, but preferably a month (week for Detox/3 weeks at their program upstairs) to get off this once and for all.

I feel like i don't wanna waste the progress I've already made, and their might not be any better time than now.

Anyone have a clue if a month is long enough? I've come off oxys even dope on my own while still working, but never after this long and never after fet so idk what to expect..

Please help guys, I really need this 🙏 ",2,4,2025-01-22 12:28:50,sobriety work 've working amazon dsp almost 2 years straight worked right homelessness using drug program resources catalyst leave long term program got job fedex warehouse uber eats much using rental live ue saved enough payback money luckily mother let use money get car used newly purchased used car live work time dsp amazon sounds great right however process getting high girl fell program time felt like needed keep sane okay living way work hard possible would n't fail long story short 's 2 years later 've tolerance wise never sober maybe 8-10 hours always least 2-3 bags day fet last week really got family really hit core made realize badly want normal sober 'm tired present every moment life feels like walking coma 2 years drive living ca n't stomach putting lives risk including last week 'll everyday 've tiniest bumps imaginable stave withdrawal trying prep mind body full withdrawal guys honestly think keep prepping take loa soon humanely possible gon na wait lease 'm considering taking month maybe month half preferably month week detox/3 weeks program upstairs get feel like n't wan na waste progress 've already made might better time anyone clue month long enough 've come oxys even dope still working never long never fet idk expect .. please help guys really need 🙏

Is addiction always indicative of mental issues?,"I have been thinking about this a lot lately. Obviously addiction is a hallmark feature of mental health issues/disorders.

However… is it possible to develop an addiction simply because you just absolutely love drugs and the way they make you feel?

Never felt like celebrating any of my achievements. Drugs just make me feel whole.

Mixing tapentadol and oxycodone.,"I’m wanting to be safe when doing so, so looking for advice/experiences. How do you find mixing tapentadol and oxycodone?
As you know at higher doses of tapentadol you can get some dysphoria and irritation. I find when I take a tolerable amount of tapentadol (100-150mg SR) and try to increase opiod effects by bumping this up slightly with oxycodone. It’s then like I’ve taken more tapentadol, I don’t necessarily get more euphoria like I might with just oxycodone.
This might seem like an easy solution, but I have a lot more access to tapentadol than I do to oxycodone.
Any other else have experience with mixing this chemistry?

Why does the ER never adjust for tolerance when addressing a pain crisis? Like sure lets be way less efficient and draw this out,"I just don’t understand the thought process. Like you are going to use more or the same amount of medication over a longer period of time than if you just give that dose the first time. I’ve been on opioids for 1.5 years, 0.5mg of dilaudid is not going to take me out of a pain flare up severe enough to need the emergency room. At least start with 1mg. Cause what ended up happening is this doctor kept ordering 0.5mg and we did that 4 times over probably 4 hours. Eventually something worked in the end but it took a while and was just needlessly drawn out.

I started using last Monday still haven't pooped,"Update: I did an enema got a little bit out but not even close to a weeks worth, then I took a higher dose of milk of magnesia (60mg) and boy did it ever work!

I just recently relapsed and started using dilaudid again and since I have last Monday I have only pooped once and it was like nothing. That's going on 7 days now without a real bowel movement. I took miralax and milk of magnesia today still haven't taken a poop.

I'm getting quite worried about this, although I don't have any symptoms of a blockage except nausea (could just be from being high tho lol). I just want to get this out of me right now but it feels like it's never gonna come

I've been through the opiates poops before but it's never seemed like I went this long without a bowel movement before.

Subs Destroying my health,"So I've been on subs for about 2 years now, I've recently gone through so many tests through the doctor because of my rapid weight loss and horrible anxiety and pretty much every symptom in the book. Even though I'm eating and working out, seriously eating as much as I can. I've lost another like 35 lb in the last few months and I'm starting to think that subs are giving me adrenal failure. I'm starting my second semester of college today and I am so sick of being on these things. When you realize that you put an opiate into a prescription bottle and all of the other issues go away, the money, the time, and all the issues of addiction in my opinion disappear. So now I'm stuck between getting sick from withdrawal and getting sick after I take my sub. So I just waited 24 hours just so I could take 4 mg and kind of give my body a break from it. The truth is I'm probably going to go back to using h or oc if I can find it for a decent price. It's times like these I wish I lived in Canada where supposedly you can go get diacetyl morphine in a pill form. Anyway, I'm kind of rambling but my life on subs especially the last 6 months has been absolute hell. I did H for a decade with no side effects and I was genuinely happy, yeah I went through hell but at least I didn't feel like I was dying everyday after I took it. I'm not trying to make addiction sound amazing or glorify it, I'm just stating that look at what happens when you put an opiate into a prescription bottle. I have a steady job for 2 years, brand new vehicle, in college going to medical. The system is absolutely ridiculous that there aren't more options after I got hooked in 2009 after a surgery. If anybody has any suggestions or advice I would appreciate it because I just can't go on like this, I have never felt so sick in my life.",9,37,2025-01-20 19:30:47,subs destroying health 've subs 2 years 've recently gone many tests doctor rapid weight loss horrible anxiety pretty much every symptom book even though 'm eating working seriously eating much 've lost another like 35 lb last months 'm starting think subs giving adrenal failure 'm starting second semester college today sick things realize put opiate prescription bottle issues go away money time issues addiction opinion disappear 'm stuck getting sick withdrawal getting sick take sub waited 24 hours could take 4 mg kind give body break truth 'm probably going go back using h oc find decent price 's times like wish lived canada supposedly go get diacetyl morphine pill form anyway 'm kind rambling life subs especially last 6 months absolute hell h decade side effects genuinely happy yeah went hell least n't feel like dying everyday took 'm trying make addiction sound amazing glorify 'm stating look happens put opiate prescription bottle steady job 2 years brand new vehicle college going medical system absolutely ridiculous n't options got hooked 2009 surgery anybody suggestions advice would appreciate ca n't go like never felt sick life

So, I notice that for many opioids you are more than expected to IV only. **[skip to the end of the dangers list if you dont feel like reading]**

there doesn't seem to be any consistent guide of IVing and ways you could fuck yourself up, and it looks like a secret endless iceberg of issues. I collected over time a small list of dangers that I randomly heard on reddit posts/movies/media. It blows my mind to never have found **ANY** guide that at least inform the existence of **any of these dangers**.

1. embolism
2. cotton fever
3. Infective endocarditis
4. necrosis and lose an arm or some shit

I just know so damn little of it and there is still so many more dangers. how tf do u IV and not worry all the damn time? is there even a way to do it that you aren't counting on god to win this lottery? like sure, ik there are optimal ways to reduce harm, but is there any real secure way without counting on your luck at all?

 and like wtf, how even you get high and safe when IV lasts soo little and you have to keep applying all that secure system, over and over again each 5-60 min?

Is it normal to feel wd after tapering these pills? ,"Is it normal to experience withdrawal symptoms after tapering off these meds?

Is it normal to experience withdrawal symptoms after tapering off these meds?

Hey everyone,  
I’m 27 and I’ve been dealing with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and a long-term kratom addiction (40-60g/day for six years). I’ve been working on getting clean and have made significant progress. In early December, I was taking the following daily:

- 16mg of Buprenorphine (Suboxone)  
- 300mg of Pregabalin  
- 50-75mg of Sertraline (Zoloft)  
- 300mg of Trittico (Trazodone)  
- 30mg of Buspirone  
- 50-100mg of Betaloc (Beta-blockers)  
- Chlorprothixen when needed

This may sound like a lot, but it helped me get off kratom, which had worsened my anxiety over time. I never misused benzos, taking them only 4-5 times a year for panic attacks before kratom. After a long battle, I finally tapered down using Suboxone and managed to quit kratom.

By early December, I started reducing my medication. I felt dull, tired, emotionally numb, and lacking libido, but things improved a bit. By mid-January, I was down to only 2mg Suboxone and 150mg Wellbutrin (Bupropion). Everything else I had either tapered off or quit entirely. A couple of weeks ago, I had a rough case of COVID, which kept me on sick leave, so I decided to quit the last remnants of Pregabalin (75mg) and Sertraline (25mg). Now, I feel mentally more like myself than I have in years, with real hope for change.

However, it’s been about 8 days since I stopped Sertraline and Pregabalin, and I’m still experiencing some physical symptoms, such as:

- Poor temperature regulation  
- Sweating  
- Feeling like I have a virus  
- Fatigue and dizziness  
- These symptoms improve when I lie down.

Could these symptoms be due to my body adjusting to going from 12 pills a day to just 2 in under two months? Or could it be a lingering effect of having had COVID recently? Also, I’ve been on Wellbutrin for 11 days, and I haven’t felt any improvement yet—only discomfort. I’ve seen a doctor, and they assured me it’s not serotonin syndrome or anything too concerning.

My next step is tapering off the 2mg of Suboxone, but after reducing from 16mg to 2mg and coming off all these meds, I feel confident I can handle it. Has anyone had a similar experience with tapering meds this drastically? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks so much!

I've noticed a lot of my music taste is influenced by my opiate addiction. Most of the music I listen to is because I either used it to get through withdrawals or I used it to complement the high. I'm specifically asking about music that gives you feelings similar to when you're on opioids, and not just because you used to listen to it when you were on opiates. I'm looking for music that sounds like it IS an opioid high. Here's some that I've accumulated, as examples:

* Via Chicago - Wilco (This one kind of sounds like withdrawals, too lol)

"Interesting question I want all of your thoughts so, currently my DOC is Tapentadol, however it’s very low mu affinity has given me an idea.","So I boof Tapentadol using the sims position post plunge, I usually use around 100mg, if you boof properly you can get a bioavailability of around 80% this involves laying on ur left side so the drug can’t go up into the upper rectum which sits slightly on the right, so after this for 20/30 mins let’s say 80mg absorbed Tapentadol is in my blood. After researching so much, the best I’ve found is that Tapentadol’s my agonism is 18 x weaker than morphine which means at 80 mg it’s equivalent to roughly 4.44mg of morphine but also doesn’t fully activate the receptor like morphine.

My question is about tramadol and Tapentadol as a mix, so because Tapentadol has negligible serotonin effects there is no chance of serotonin syndrome, it does however increase the reuptake of norepinephrine by around 30-60% depending on dose which is probably why it’s still a decent drug for me even though it’s mu potency is low. 
Now my question is about tramadol, as both of these drugs are relatively cheap, I wanted to see if this would be something that could really boost the opioid part of the high. So we know tramadol is usually 0.1 compared to morphine so 100mg is 10mg of morphine, so I looked into bioavailability and it’s around 70% but then every dose after sort of synergises with what’s left in your body and you’re able to go up to 90% bioavailability. Tramadol if you’re a good or average metaboliser would turn 70mg tramadol into 7/10.5mg of ODSMT which is argued to be 0.5-1x potency of morphine as well as tramadol giving u that nice serotonin reuptake feeling. 

So I was thinking I can get strips of both for super cheap and dose 100mg Tapentadol and then take 100mg tramadol at onset, then add another 100mg of tramadol maybe 30 mins to an hour later.

The thing is this would mean you would have 4.44morphine equivalent in Tapentadol, and then from the first tramadol pill 7/10.5mg ODSMT, and then second tramadol pill with a slightly higher bioavailability would mean you have between 9-13.5, so roughly 16mg-24mg of ODSMT if we compare that with its approximate agonism to mu with morphine it’s either 0.5/1x as good as morphine so let’s take a middle ground of 20mg of ODSMT which could have mu agonism at the equivalent of 10/20mg morphine add our Tapentadol in leads to 14.4-24.4 mu agonism in comparison to morphine.

Any people with harsh mental illnesses have advice on living without opioids?,"Mostly people say opioids stand in their way of living a normal life. Somehow for me it's the opposite. Don't get me wrong, they're ruining my life, but only internally. On the outside I can hold a stable job and excell at it, even get compliments from my boss for improving constantly. I keep learning new skills in life and move forward in what I want to be. Unfortunately I have some underlying health problems and Opioids keeping my cough and phlegm in might be fatal for me some day. I have not been healthy for over half a year now and it's getting worse. 

The thing is that without Opioids my mind wages war on my soul. I have some mental illnesses such as cPTSD, Schizotypal Disorder (may be misdiagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia), Avoidant & Borderline Personality Disorder, Depression, Generalized & Social Anxiety Disorder and some more on top of that. I basically tend to use Opioids as my medication for everything. I've tried most kinds of psychiatric stuff so far which didn't really work as expected and recently got kicked out of therapy (in my country you have a max amount of hours you can take until you need a 2 year break or else you need to pay an awful lot).

I can't talk to people normally without them, I can't be disciplined with my passions, and basically my life stops moving. I retreat to other types of avoidance like other drugs or excessive media consumption if no opioids are there.

It feels like my whole life depends on them and life is simply not worth living without them. The medical system was not effective for me, and I tried many different religions and spiritual types of living which all didn't work.

I need help, desperately, but I don't know what help this could be.

Using Suboxone to prevent opiate dependence,"Is there any evidence or logic in taking Suboxone after a few days of opiate use to clear any binding to the receptors? I know it's the naloxone that specifically can cause precipitated withdrawals for doing just that, but what if it's used on a schedule like 2 or 3 days opiates, 1 day sub, and never become dependant to either? 

I'm about to go into a sub program and this is just one of the weird intrusive thoughts I'm having at the moment. 

While I'm here, can I avoid Suboxone dependence by using 2 days and 1 day off, or some similar schedule? 

I work on a seasonal island and I fear running out of my script and being stuck on an island with no pharmacy, if the planes or boats are cancelled due to weather. It happens a handful of times each summer and can last anywhere from 1-4 days depending on the storm.

I’ve taken the coating off all the pills, I’m just curious about the matrices of each pill; I’ve heard that you can’t do shit about the XR release of the Oxydolors, is this true? 

However, the Oxypros and OCs seem to be basically IR when you take the costing off according to the posts I’ve seen.

Im at the end...dont know what to do ,"im still crying and getting Panikc attacks (most likely ptsd)  all the time, right at the moment than im sober... now i had a 10 week moderate cycle (nothing crazy 2nd).everything was on point school work Dieter sleep Training everything was on point. I was healthy bloodwork was ok too.
 Couldnt find any gear anymore. And that was the beginning of the end..

So i was sober again.. and i started to cry and so shit again. Everything seems to be meaningless. Everything is allright..everything is fine.. i go to work, im getting good Marks at school. I nearly dont train and i dont give a fuck about my Diet.. Im getting weaker anyways in a rapide speed. Ive lost 5.5kg in 7 weeks... and ive lost so much strenght all gone away. But thats not the point. 
So being sober is an absolute nightmare. Im criying  and so shit.. but icw still work and school.. 

So instand of criying i started drinking alcohol at work. Before the work in the mornkng, in the lunchbreak, evening, non stop a lil bit 1 2 drinks herein and there... not getting drunk but all the time

After that i thaught to myself ive to change something. If i drink all day for longer ill get an alcoholic. So Switched to taking opiods. Most of the time tilidin.  Started with 250mg (for 10 years it was always so im pain patient, have scoliosis) that was my whole life my golden Spot. It was enough. 

Than, while wrestling, i felt down to the right, but my right foot was still on the ground. My Training Partner caught me but i still fucked up my right foot. Was forced to be at home the whole time. And i got really immense pain and being home the whole time and not having anything to do drives me crazy. And the doc didnt allow me to train with a good reason (my foot). So i went higher in the dosage.

Now im working again.. and do everything too but still not Training more than once a werk or so.. then i consumed in 2 days 50mg tramadol 450mg tapentadol and some dhc dont know the dosage. And couldnt get anything more. 
First day was ok i felt a lil bit weak. 
2nd day i understoood that im (opiods)addicted again.(the last time it was before 8 years or so).

(Ive to be in the train for 4 hours everyday and that diverse me vrazy ive to move my msucles have spastics and that males me also aggressive) 

Day 3 i Went crazy in the night. Got some Monet from my lil sister 10 euros and bought me woth that 5 oxy 5mg. And ive Finished them in 12 hours. That was thursday. I went to my doc and dxplained him that im addicted and that i dont know what to. That i need help bc of my ptsd and now fucking opiod addiction. I said to him that my daily dosage would be 400mg of tildin per day and that i go higher by the day and that my consume has nothing tobdo with pain its bc i cry if not i cant do it without.  He gave me 1 100mg tilidin and 8 150mg. After that i bought 1mg xanax and 5x5mg oxys too. 

My doc said to me i should Visit him than i need help or than something happened. And i should Tell him than ive holidays. So he could send me to psychotherapy for ptsd and (opiid)Turkey. Which ive in june 😭. On wednesday ive my free day this week so i can Visit him than again. 

Yesterday i gave a really bad friend (since first grade or even vefore)  2 of the tildin. Snd he still asks me for tilidik and i only habe 2 left)Hes addicted too (he was always coke and gambling addicted)his father died beodre a few months ago and he took fentanyl and nearly everything. Yesterday i took something like 15mg oxys and 300 tildin. 😭😭. Yesterday i worked and my foot started to hurt again even oxys didnt reduce the pain as needed (ive to walk and ''run'' the whole day. And i dont want to not go to work bc were 3 workers in my department, so if someone is missing its most likely the other ones have to work alone and thats hard. 

Today i had free.In that night i slept for 13 hrs. And after waking up i ate for 2hrs. So i only had half of the day to consume and i still Manager to use 300mg tilis and 5mg oxys. And my foot still hurts. I took my 150 tilli in the ''morning''. Than now 1 oxy and after that i still nearly cried and so i took 150mg tllidin again and i still want to take one more..😢(and my foot still hurted till now.) 

I dont want it anymore.. thats no condition. Fucking hardcore opiod addic. Fucking Junky. I hate myself. I hate the World. I hate the System and everything else. I want to end it but i wont😢😢. I need help. Im fucked. I dont know what to do how to survive. And I will go highher in dosage.. ive no money.. i get 800 per month.  I go fuckinf higher in dosage and higher. I know that i  should go down and i wamt to and want to come off at least from opioids, not from steroids (they make my life surviveble they give it structure without im absolute Chaos ive not adhd im adhd, but i cant. I cant without them..( or gear) the other options would be alcoholic (that would be the worst option). And other option (cant be done, opiod addict is far better) is getting back on antidepressants and antipsychotics (i wont i would rather die) bc of the side Effekts and their absurdly brutal withdrawl ( i would rather quit opiods 100 Times cold than once that shit). Once i had non of them and i felt like dying. That would be ok but not in that way. With Cramps and in delirium for 3 days in vacation. That was hard. And their fucking nasty sideeffects. Antidepressants make me dont come.. no matter how hard i try after going and doing the craziest shit maybe it will happen with a lot of luck after 2 hours or so... and fucking antipsychotics give me the most brutal rls and spastics known to human race.(i quit zhem 5 years ago (with psychedelics and without any withdrwl and i still have Bad rls from them therefor i didnt had that shit) Yes they knock me the fuck out at first but than after bildung up some tolerante im awake enough to feel the fucking spasms and rls. Im than like on waay tonmuch xtc.and that shit makes me stupid as fuck. Its neurotic as hell and i dont want to loose even more intellience than ive already done. Im still far more  intelligent than most of other humans, but i refuse to take fucking antidepressants and antipsychotics and getting more stupid. In my Look at the World and phylosophy its a big crime against humanity, human rights, freedom.. that they force me not to take gear(so i can get my life together)  and what is even a much bigger crime is that they force me to take antipsychotics and antidepressants. Even than i say that i dont want them. Im even rattert be a  junky a fucking opiod addict than doing These to groups again. Im rattert dead than using antidepressants antipsychotics again. Its the worst thing ti be on. Why they have to make my life so hard i could take gear and at least come off everything else.. and they dont want me to be on opiods either.. they will me to quit opids and start with my so hated antidepressants and antipsychotics again bc they fuck my life makes me so addicted that i most likely will neuer come off them and they make me stupid and a stupid Population is easy to Control. They want me to be fucked and get rich by that.. i hope they burn in hell for that shit.

Need feedback please ,"Generic Brand 

Hi, I have a genuine question, I have taken all different types of Buphnorphine (Subutex) brands colors ect never paying any attention to it. Always felt same - Only difference between them I realized in past was some dissolved quicker than others. On that note. I just got my 2 MG from Walgreens and brand is Actavis, (I know I have taken orange in past, what brand no clue) however right now I feel so shacky, legs restless, feel like blood sugar is low that faint feeling, been so tired too and super cold hands- do you think this is because of the brand? Your opinion is it too weak or strong? Same dose 1 year no issues but this time around I am having big issues, ears burning too, headache. Should I take a little more until I can talk to doctor on Monday or perhaps pharmacist can do something? Your advice would greatly be appreciated or input.

FROM OXY TO 7 HYDROXY ,"I use real oxycodone every now and then, and I can take up to 120 mg for a very, very good nod. I also use kratom daily but in small amounts. Yesterday, I took my usual 120 mg of oxycodone and got a decent buzz, but oxycodone is expensive where I’m from.

A friend told me to try the Press’d 30 mg hulks. So today, I went and bought them and took all three tablets. I wasn’t expecting much because my tolerance to oxycodone is so high. I thought, there’s no way these tablets compare to oxycodone.

But, dude, tell me why these three tablets hit way harder than the 120 mg of oxy I took yesterday—and the buzz lasted way longer. Now I get why people take 7-hydroxy. I did have to take some Zofran to combat the nausea, but, Jesus Christ, those tablets slapped so hard.

Can someone explain this? How are these tablets so strong, so cheap, and still legal? I’m about to go buy more today. Does anyone know of any stronger tablets than the Press’d ones?

Depressed and lonely ,"Hello everyone, guess I'm just making this post to vent/rant but lately I've been feeling so low about myself and I feel like oxy is the only thing that makes me tolerate myself and situation I'm in 

To start with I'm constantly feeling disrespected by pretty much everyone that comes in my life, from managers/coworkers to even friends.

2nd thing is I'm so lonely, recently got out of a really toxic situationship(she was a narcissist who spread lies and rumours about me) especially when she couldn't get her way. I tend to attract those types of people, maybe I give off a weak vibe which makes people feel like they can get away with treating me like shit. ( Which they can unfortunately).

 I guess a part of my drug usage comes from wanting to feel loved and appreciated but I've genuinely never experienced that feeling even from my own family, I overheard my mother once say "" he was an accident"" which may have caused some of the abuse mostly physical and emotional in early childhood.

I just feel like my whole life is a struggle and feeling inadequate, chasing this feeling of love so hard that I've lost myself in the process.

I genuinely don't know what to do and the oxy has such a grip on my life I hate it, but at the same time it's the only thing that gives me some relief and to be able to get through the day.

Any support/ advice would be greatly appreciated.",3,13,2025-01-18 04:50:50,depressed lonely hello everyone guess 'm making post vent/rant lately 've feeling low feel like oxy thing makes tolerate situation 'm start 'm constantly feeling disrespected pretty much everyone comes life managers/coworkers even friends 2nd thing 'm lonely recently got really toxic situationship narcissist spread lies rumours especially could n't get way tend attract types people maybe give weak vibe makes people feel like get away treating like shit unfortunately guess part drug usage comes wanting feel loved appreciated 've genuinely never experienced feeling even family overheard mother say `` accident '' may caused abuse mostly physical emotional early childhood feel like whole life struggle feeling inadequate chasing feeling love hard 've lost process genuinely n't know oxy grip life hate time 's thing gives relief able get day support/ advice would greatly appreciated
Intranasal oxy isnt a waste,"So tired of people in here telling me snorting my oxy is a waste lol. Faster onset = lower effective dose needed to get desired effects. The bioavailability isn't even that bad either intranasal. 

Anyway here you go for the doubters 

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4006196/


""There are several important study results. First, crushed OxyContin was rapidly absorbed by the IN route and was reliably detected in plasma within 5 minutes of dosing. Second, OxyContin had high intranasal bioavailability: 78% and 75% after 15 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg, respectively. Third, the t1/2 of IN OxyContin was approximately 3.5 hours and was not statistically different than the t1/2 of 3.3 hours for IV oxycodone.

I went cold turkey of oxy and lyrica at home … and now I’ve taken some oxy today will I be okay. ,"**WARNING: graphic TMI details about the withdraw**   
  
Okay so yes I’m dumb., moving along.  
  
**Quick History to provide context**
   

**Feb 2nd 2024**: went cold turkey and stayed clean for a few months. During that withdraw I vomited on day 5 only and otherwise it was only diarrhoea quite bad..  

June 2024: relapsed on my habit but even higher mg of oxycontins and oxycodone sandoz + up to 2000mg of lyrica every single day.   

   
10 days ago: went cold turkey oxy and lyrica. It was HELL. Now I’ve started taking fucking lyrica in the last 2 days and I took oxy 2 days ago and zero withdrawal symptoms and then took a bit more today…. 
     
  
If the worst of it is over (I vomited for 4 days straight and the diarrhoea holy hell thank god I had a waterproof mattress cover but I was so unwell I was timing the vomiting it was literally between 5-20 minute intervals and lasted for like 4-6 days straight and shitting the bed and stuff was dreadful. I was so weak and dizzy and sick I just gave up knowing I would need to wash EVERYTHING.   
  
I’m not gonna lie to was a really
Traumatic withdrawal I did not think it would be that bad because the first time I went cold turkey I only vomited on day and j thought that was hell (I have emetophobia which is fear of vomiting lol)( 

But yeah I obviously still have very bad pain which is the reason I take oxycodone etc in the first place.. today my back was in agony so I took some instant release oxynorms 50mg of those but being instant release they only lasted like 2 hours… so then I got my slow releases OxyContin and have taking a 30mg & 20mg. I feel fuuucked up. Right before I quit I was taking 240mg with 2100mg lyrica (pregablin) just to try and feel and I couldn’t feel anything I wouldn’t nod nothing.  
  
Today on the 50mg slow release I’ve taken I’m nodding so much and feel completely fucked up.  
   
But I’m also scared that I’m going to be vomiting again.   
   
Should I “taper” off using the 5mg instant release I’ve got?  
   
  
Or will I be okay considering it was ONE DAY. And no I will not take anymore blah blah blah because I’m so stressed beyond belief about how bad the withdrawal is I can’t believe I took them but now I’ve scared myself completely off them. I’m terrified of those withdraws I’ve never felt thag sick in my life I thought I was doing to die.  
    
  
Thank you to anyone who can answer. Yea it’s dumb to take them STRAIGHT after coming off them cold turkey I know I know I am so stupid and have so much regret and now anxiety I do not want to vomit again.   
  
**TL;DR**. 
Went cold turkey off pharma grade oxycodone & lyrica (240mg oxy, 2100mg+ lyrica daily) had a very traumatic withdraw of vomiting and shitting for 5 days straight. Now a few days later I took oxy and a little lyrica because pain and I wanted a little relief at the tail end of my withdraw.. then had a day of no oxy but some lyricas, I just then I took more oxy today. My tolerance is extremely lowered (I’ve taken 40mg instant which was strong but then I took some long lasting ones 50Mg and I’m absolutely fucked like nodding really hard etc…. Crazy because 14 days ago 240mg did nothing and now 50mg has me fucked up. Anyway I have a vomiting phobia and I am terrified of vomitng again. I am so so so scared and I have learned my fucking lesson to never touch this shit again due to the fear I have right now..

Real hallucinations on oxy/weed,"Took popped 22.5mg, snorted 7.5mg and smoked a joint. I noticed I started getting very minor auditory (random banging, wind/whispers) and visual (shadow people) hallucinations. Eventually the paranoia went away and the hallucinations stopped. After a little while the weed finally potentiated the high and I nodded in and out for 5-6 hours. Overall I’m not sure if mix the two again. I kind of enjoy oxy by itself even though the high was way better when combined with weed. The hallucinations could have also been caused by lack of sleep. I’d just gone on a dextroamph binge right before and only slept 3 or 4 hours so that probability didn’t help.

The only time I truly feel at ease is when I take my medication,"I’m prescribed oxycodone, and alprazolam, but I often exceed the prescribed dosage. As a result, I frequently run out of my medication several days before I’m able to refill it. While the medication helps me manage my symptoms, I’ve become dependent on it. When I run out, I feel lethargic, depressed, and go through withdrawal symptoms. To get by, I sometimes buy weed, which helps provide some relief until my next refill.

Subuxone with no tolerance,"I’ve seen a few people on this app now ask if it’s safe to take subuxone with a very little or no tolerance to opiates. I am going to answer most of what you guys need to know so you don’t end up sick for hours. First, for a first time user I would crush the pill up and snort little lines at a time and work your way upto a buzz you enjoy. Sublingual is much harder to divide depending if your pill has slits or not, you could end up very sick. Do not snort more than maybe 0.5mg - 1mg for your first time or you will most likely get sick. I take 25-50mg promethazine with it to ease some of the opiate nausea, usually I don’t get sick at all if I throw promethazine into the mix.

Best way to make the dope last?,"I’m trying to figure out how make my H (actual H not fent, I’m from Europe) last the longest. I’m not really taking it to get high anymore it’s mostly just to stave off withdrawals. My preferred ROA is IV but lately I’ve been wondering if it would last longer if smoked? Since with IV you have the amount you cook up and then it’s gone, where as if you smoke it you could just take enough hits to get rid of wd and then save the foil until it’s empty, perhaps? Or does the difference in BA make IV the more efficient choice anyways? What about duration, does it last longer smoked or slammed? It’s been a while since I smoked.

It's crazy how good an endorphin rush can be,"Just finished my bodyweight workout, went pretty hard.  
Vaped some weed too and now I'm feeling fucking fantastic, it pretty accurately resembles a mid strength opioid high for me.  
Floaty, warm and cozy body feeling, tingling face, calm but alert mind, the feeling of every fibre of muscle being massaged.

Took kratom a couple times after my workout and it's definitely enjoyable, but the kratom interferes with my sleep and doesn't seem to add anything substantial to how I already feel, so I quit doing it after workout.

Can only recommend a good training session for that natural opioid high!

What's your experiences?

Withdrawal / sub induction,"
Friends, without going in to too much meaningless detail, I have found myself taking 240 mg of oxy day, with roughly 2/3 of that that being taken at 8 or 9 at night. I work tomorrow (1/17) but I don't have to go back until (1/22 - next Wednesday).

As far as comfort meds go I have:
2 - 8mg subs
15 -  1mg alprazolam
15 - 300 mg gabapentin
30 loperamide. 

Tomorrow (Friday 1/17) I plan to take only 180 mg of oxy, but I need advice in inducing on subs and coming up with a plan on taking AS LITTLE SUB AS POSSIBLE. I am thinking that Saturday I will take 3mg. Sunday 2mg. Monday 1mg and drop from there.  

I am familiar with the COWS scale and plan to wait 24 hours until I take my first subs dose, but making it to 24 hours is the difficult part.  Can anyone provide advice about that? When do I take the gaba? How much?

Any and all advice would be much appreciated.  I'd like to free once again. However, I'm not taking Kratom, I'm not interested in long term sub use, and I won't take subs for more than 4 days.

Snorted tramadol - BURNS LIKE HELL?? ,"Right so I've done ket, oxy, morphine and stuff like that nasally... It's all good. Decided tonight to try with tramadol (supposed to absorb better nasally), but oh my goood, i have never experienced anything that hurts this much to snort.

It's not normal tramadol, it was just called ODSM tramadol or something (red pills, didn't come in a packaging). They are 200mg extended release pills and therefore stronger than the normal ones. So I'm wondering if tramadol is just way more painful to do nasally than any other thing, or if it's just this specific pill? 

I've been taking them orally for months so i know they're ""real"" and work like they should.. Was gonna do like 30mg nasally to test, but after doing half in one nostril it really doesn't feel safe at all do do the rest lol.

Can dogs that are sniffing carry on bags at a cruise terminal smell opiates if you have them in your female pocket?,"I plan on vacuum sealing the shit out of it.

"Interview with an Oxy addict,have you guys watched that video on YT?","So on YouTube there is a video that shows 2 addicts named Nalu and Jango,Nalu said that he used to smoke 40 pills a day,and he says that he smokes 30mg Oxys 
In a part of the video Nalu says that he was paying 50 dollars per pill and if he really was smoking 40 everyday how tf is this possible?That mean he was spending 2000 dollars a day on pills?
The second question i ask is:are they smoking real oxys or fake m30s?
The video is 10 yrs old now and from what i know,Nalu and Jango are from Hawaii,is it even possible that 10yrs ago they were smoking fake M30s?
Im not American and idk how the opioid situation was 10yrs ago.
From what i know,its impossible to smoke real Oxys,they will just catch fire on the foil and the pill will not slide like heroin or other smokeable substances.
Is this video real or fake and maded just for views?

Yall..I've been sober since 12/26,"19 whole days. I haven't been sober for more than 5 days since 2017. My ""quitting "" came from anger.  Tired of having to reach out and be sugary nice to people who I do not actually like so that they will serve me. Tired of juggling the little money that I don't spend on pills between my bills. I'm tired of not paying my bills on time. I'm tired of Lying to people So I can borrow money. I'm tired of never buying anything because I'd rather buy pills. I'm tired of being wracked with guilt every time the pills are gone and bills are left. Tired of my daughters not living like normal people because they have functioning addict for a mother. Tired of not being a good example. Tired of feeling so useless I wanna od. Just tired. 

I blocked everyone and every time I think about them I get so damn angry. They tripped over themselves to supply me even when Id ask them not to.  When i blocked the number they called from other phones. When i moved over an 1 1/2 away, they volunteered to drive to me.  That's what happens when you pay fast, buy the most, and you include a tip if they come by you first. You're the preferred customer and they know your weakness. Every time I told them I was done they'd call just to ""check on me"" and slyly let me know they had something in case I needed a little something and I always gave in just like they knew I would. Not this fuckin time. 


Honestly there this old perverted guy that gets 180 10mg percs and he lives for the times I have no money.  The 18 months after I met him I found myself doing  things I cried about later and every time was the last time. He actually hates when i have money.  I'm upset with myself about that. I miss the woman I was. She would never. I feel like calling his Dr and telling them to do a pill count on his ass but im not a hater and I believe in karma. 

Please wish me luck and strength. I have my moments every day but I try to make myself wait 15 minutes before I place any calls and then i use that time to talk myself off the ledge or watch one of the many videos I have of me crying and begging MYSELF to stop killing me.  It's been working so far.  When I told myself even if I slip once I can get back on track, I thought I was giving myself a pass and miraculously I didn't take it. I don't know how but I didnt. I could call 5 different people now but I haven't. No clear reason why not, i just haven't. I'm so proud of that. 

Been in addiction since 2008 and have never gone a full week without pills.  At one time I was taking (10) 10/325 perc or norcos at once like 3xs a day.. I don't know why I'm not dead. When I did have a script of 60 I'd be out in 2 days. I also had a physical last week of December and even after 16 years and thousands and thousands of pills with acetaminophen my liver is OK too. I couldn't believe when my Dr said that.  That also aids me in choosing better. Feels so weird to have spending money again. THAT is the biggest oddity to me.

Everything but being high sucks.,"I am so unhappy and I don't know how to deal with it. Everything just feels so bleak and the only time I can actually remember feeling good in the past 5 years at least is when I was high.

I got prescribed tapentadol post-surgery about a year ago, didn't think anything of it at the time but some months later I was having an extra garbage time and messed around with it, I was fully aware it was stupid but I thought it was more reversable than my other ideas at the time so I went with it. I'm so used to feeling either nothing or bad that having everything dulled out by euphoria kept me doing it, then like a year later my brother had surgery and I fished his unfinished script out of the trash and stole it, not exactly my proudest moment but I got over it pretty quick.

I feel like a garbage person for doing it at all and I feel like an even more garbage person that I'd do more and worse stuff in a heart beat if I wasn't a socially fucked hermit. Haven't done anything in over a month at this point but the feeling won't go away, it sucks.

What lesser known drugs pharm or elicit ease fent w/d? Just curious about personal experiences!,So my curiosity comes from when I was a teenager. My ex's mom and her friends were heroin addicts. When they couldn't get ahold of any they would smoke crack and didn't seem to have any w/ds. I know about the basic things your dr will give to ease certain symptoms but I'm curious if anyone found something lesser know. That eased either w/d or even slowed the onset.

"Advice for synthetic opioids WD, meds I have to use to help...","Hello everyone,

I recently spoke to an addiction Dr. and talked with him about options for at home WD, he was opposed to it and really wanted me to either A. go to a clinic and get methadone daily or B. get blood work and piss test done to get on subs. I told him I was against both as they WDs I've heard are way worse than any opioids and hurt much worse (twice as long duration, slower half life as I know).

He was opposed to at home WD but he said only because the long term effects don't do anything to fight against the mental cravings or the chance of relapse is much higher. I didn't argue with him but long story short I convinced him to prescribe his *""At Home Withdrawal Kit""* which composed of the following...

* **Trazodone** 50 MG tablets. Qty: 20
* **Gabapentin** 300 MG capsules. Qty 30
* **Ondansetron** HCL aka Zofran 4 MG tablets. Qty 10
* **Clonidine** 0.1 MG/24 HR WEEKLY. Qty 1 Transdermal Patch (this dosage seems low but a patch is kinda nice not to worry about for 7 days)

My Mom also knows I will be going into WD in the next 12 hours and gave me **Duloxetine** (Cymbalta) HCL 20 MG capsules Qty 17. The other med is called **Clonazepam** (Klonopin) 0.5 MG tablet, Qty 22.

I just wanted to know besides the Doctors recommendations if anyone has some good advice on what to take that will help (I don't need to describe the WD effects, everyone knows the main ones *RLS, temp control, anxiety, insomnia, etc...*). I will start WD around 6-9 hours from now. I tried looking it up and descriptions didn't help much but for all these meds do I need to wait X amount of time since last opioid dosage to take any of the WD meds?

The stuff my Mom gave to help out, she mentioned one of them, I can't remember honestly which one, I could ask her but she said one of them helps you be happier...? She said that I am not sure either the Klonopin or Cymbalta but she said those will help me in WDs, maybe someone can chime in.

  
Oh forgot to mention, if anyone cares as to why I believe this is the worst WD ever for me and worse than any typical Norco, Perc, m30, etc... WD. Is because I discovered what they swapped as a opiate in the m30s, instead of the typical oxy used it was swapped with **Protonitazene** (A Synesthetic Opioid) first made in the 50s. It is incredibly strong, they say stronger than fent and I really enjoyed how long it lasted. For example, 1 pill would literally last me 12 hours or so, not high that whole time but no like WD feeling or anything like that just felt normal. Anyway that is what I am 95% sure is in it, and that is why the WD is so intense.

Any questions I'll do my best to respond asap but the longer the wait till a question appears the more into WD I'll probably be, spare me the criticism. 

Thank you everyone for reading my long ass post, sorry I ramble on sometimes, just skip over it if its too much lol.

Am I going about this right? Methadone analog/Suboxone question,"Okay so in the past I've been wildly reckless and never gotten pwd. I've literally done .25 of good dope and 6 hours later 4mg sub and been fine. However this time I'm a little more apprehensive to just fuck around and find out so here's where I'm at. 

So normally I take 4mg bupe subucally a day. Well I got some methiodone in and I took a few days off to sample it. I used it for like 3 days, maybe the equivalent of like 40-60mg of 'done a day. This stuff has a similar half life, and it's been 36 hours since my last dose of it.

About 1:15 ago I took .5mg subucally, and I felt okay so far, so I took another .5 less than 5mg ago. I definitely was starting to feel on the edge before I took that first piece.

How do you feel on opioids?,"My main experiences are with Morphine, oxycodone and Tianeptine.

I'm prescribed Ritalin for my ADHD and it helps alot especially with my executive dysfunction. Opioids however, are something else.

I started using as a way of self medicating but I eventually realised that they help me way more than any stims I've ever tried. I become energetic, my motivation and focus are back on track. I become very social and happy in way, like I can actually live life the way it's supposed to be/like most people actually live it.

Stims do the same but they feel kinda 'forced', opioids on the other hand feel so fucking natural.

The only problem is that I became physically dependent after awhile and well withdrawals suck ass.

Naturally high tolerance?,"I recently started getting back into opiates after a rather long break. I had been using poppy seed tea very successfully for several years when the quality was much better and they were widely available. The feeling and pain relief was amazing. When I was a teenager I also dabbled in hydros, oxys, and opana when they were available and always really enjoyed the feeling. 

For a the last few months I have been picking up pharma oxy dolors and mundis (80 MG ER) and taking them both orally and snorting them after either crushing them up (chewing) or using a wet paper towel to remove the outside coating and then crushing and snorting or just swallowing. The feeling I am getting is very muted and I wonder if people can develop a natural tolerance oxy or if I’m doing something inefficient when I take them. My first dose of the day hits okay for 1-2 hours and if I wait 5-8 hours after I am usually able to redose and get an even more mild feeling of euphoria. I am taking 1-3 80 mg pills at a time.

Most recently I had been off the oxy mundis for 2 weeks before picking up another order and even after being off them for two weeks (was taking Kratom during those weeks) the feeling is a bit of a let down compared to the cost. 

I started taking Zoloft earlier this year. I wonder if that could be blocking the effects at all? Is there anything else that could be causing resistance to the euphoric feeling of opiates given that when I was younger I had no problem feeling great after a few 5 mg hydros. Since they are ER is there a better way to ingest them other than just crushing them up?

In theory these are real pharmas and I get them from a reputable source which I trust and does a lot of volume. I have an order out for #4 H so will see how that feels. I really miss the euphoria and relief I got from PST but my sense is that market just isn’t going to recover to a place where I can get seeds like I had been in 2015-2020.",1,1,2025-01-14 19:37:00,naturally high tolerance recently started getting back opiates rather long break using poppy seed tea successfully several years quality much better widely available feeling pain relief amazing teenager also dabbled hydros oxys opana available always really enjoyed feeling last months picking pharma oxy dolors mundis 80 mg er taking orally snorting either crushing chewing using wet paper towel remove outside coating crushing snorting swallowing feeling getting muted wonder people develop natural tolerance oxy ’ something inefficient take first dose day hits okay 1-2 hours wait 5-8 hours usually able redose get even mild feeling euphoria taking 1-3 80 mg pills time recently oxy mundis 2 weeks picking another order even two weeks taking kratom weeks feeling bit let compared cost started taking zoloft earlier year wonder could blocking effects anything else could causing resistance euphoric feeling opiates given younger problem feeling great 5 mg hydros since er better way ingest crushing theory real pharmas get reputable source trust lot volume order 4 h see feels really miss euphoria relief got pst sense market ’ going recover place get seeds like 2015-2020
whats up with ER hydromorphone,"i get mundi 4mg (EU) capsules with the beads and this shit just doesnt hit right. if youre familiar with canadian HM contin i would assume its very similar. they got the little beads inside which are insanely hard to crush up for sniffing. idk if im just doing it wrong or what but today i spend like 30 minutes crushing the absolute fuck out of them to get it as fine as possible and it still hits the same. 
now dont get me wrong it still hits and i like them quite a lot i just feel like 20mgs of hydromorphone should get me way more fucked up than i am right now.

Equivalency of Hydromorphone and Heroin?,"Just curious about the equivalency of Hydromorphone and Heroin. 

How much Hydromorphone (oral) is equal to high quality #4 Heroin (~90% diacetylmorphine, insufflated) on a milligram per milligram basis?

Just looking for an approximation if possible, doesn't need to be super accurate.

After some quick research it seems like based on their potency in comparison to morphine, and factoring in the bioavailability of each method (oral vs. intranasal), that there wouldn't be much difference in their potency in terms of weight. 

But I've also heard people say Heroin is way stronger on a miligram per miligram basis so I'm a bit confused. The math seems fairly simple but I'm also pretty dumb so not sure.

Or maybe they just can't be compared quite that easy because of the unique effect of diamorphine on the brain compared to most other opiods?

Anyone tried Opium Vapes?,"I just saw some for sale online and they were quite intriguing but I'm pretty skeptical that a vape pen would be able to heat it up to the correct temp without burning half of it.

I smoked/ate a gram of Opium almost a year ago and I think it took almost a full gram to feel anything so I assume I'd need to vape an entire cartridge for a buzz lol.

Still intriguing though as I like the thought of just puffing away at it all day, mainly for staving off withdrawals and satisfying my oral fixation. And for the record, my oral fixation is a result of vaping, definitely not sucking off random dudes, you dirty minded mfers. I'm a responsible adult. I keep bungee cords within arms reach at all times, as all flexible man should).

I personally think opium is pretty overrated (if you've tried pretty much any other opiate/opiod) and overpriced anyways but I assume it feels pretty nice if you have no tolerance. 

Anyways, sorry for the tangent. I want to know what you guys think about the feasibility of using a vape pen to smoke opium? I had my doubts about DMT pens are but those turned out okay, I just think DMT is much more susceptible to overheating. An electric nectar collector did work okay for me though so who knows. Pretty mixed reviews on the vape listing as well so kind of reluctant.

On the other hand, what's even the point of having money if not to spend it on novel drug delivery systems? Those were actually the last words my friend said before OD'ing so It seems disrespectful not to try it. Afterall I was the one who pulled the boof syringe out of his cold dead ass and hid (read: did) all his drugs and deleted his search history. 

They're relatively inexpensive but seems like a better idea to just buy a full gram for slightly more and use a better vaporizer or nectar collector.

"Fistula, harm reduction for IV use","https://wmpllc.org/ojs/index.php/jom/article/download/1015/1025/2056

A link to a paper where a patient was given a fistula for IV drug use.

I don't know how much thought has been given to it, but man, sign me up. I know it's kind of fucked up for a relatively healthy person to want a fistula to shoot up into, and I don't doubt it is without risks and downside, but it would be more than a game changer, for people who use IV and aren't seeking to quit. 

With a fistula, you could hit first time, every time, not worrying about slipping out or missing any of the shot. You could feel confident that you are getting the full dose... You could stop halfway, decide if you want to do the rest, without worrying about slipping out. 

Most importantly, you aren't destroying vein after vein and/or progressing towards jugular and femoral site injections... No abscesses from missed shots, and this next one is huge: The amount of time saved, not to mention the stress, pain, frustration, and wasted drugs from struggling to hit...

Yeah it sounds kinda extreme, but for someone who isn't interested in quitting, for various circumstances, I feel this would be a game changer for so many of us.

What’s top (worst) opiate (particularly fent/heroin) WD symptoms? IMO it’s between the chills/aches or RLS. ,"Idk I can deal with the chills, sweats, aches, diarrhea, constipation.

But those twitches/spasms, anxiety/increased heart rate, and insomnia are the fucking worst combo of symptoms for me.

Currently about 36 hours without fent. Probably my 4th/5th detox from fetty. Detoxed off of bth many times, much easier.

Rn I’ve got twitches + spasms + chills + aches + increased heart rate, insomnia. 

I’ve found that tapering down your opiate use before you run out is the best option and only take the smallest amounts just enough to make you not feel sick until you run out then by the 24-72 hrs I’m good to start micro inducing subs. Always been scared to get PWD but never have gotten it. Always taper down my H or F use then wait 1-4 days before taking 1mg suboxone plus 1mg every hour if I don’t feel worse.

PWD while on an airplane plane for 5 hours…. Horror story & how I survived 😂 (precipitated withdrawal for searchers),"I had to share this and thought someone might learn something or get a laugh. My fiancé and I just got back from Costa Rica. We’re planning our wedding down there. My DN package didn’t arrive in time so I was stuck with MINIMAL supply but thought I had enough to make it. Of course, my dope brain set in while on the trip and said “have fun, your on vacation, get high and the last day, Saturday, you can just take subs” So that’s what I did and we had an amazing vacation for the first 5 days, on day 6 I didn’t take any dope/fent and just used OxyContin thinking that would help me avoid PWDs. NOPE, boy was I wrong….

I waited and took the suboxone at the airport when I couldn’t take the regular withdrawal any longer. IMMEDIATELY I knew I made a mistake. I felt ice rush through my veins and within 30 minutes I was sent into a hell I didn’t know existed and should only be saved for the worst of human kind (which I like to think I am not). I was shaking, sweating uncontrollably, my arms and legs felt like they were going to break in half, I was nauseous…. and oh, I had to board a plane for a 5 hour flight back to NY and then a 5 hour drive back home! I told my fiancé I must have gotten food poisoning but it was by far the most insane plane ride I’ve ever taken, shaking, crying, I wanted to jump out and die so badly. Somehow I managed to reach deep within my mind and so this crazy meditation that was almost an out of body experience and would last ~20 minutes at a time before being sent back into withdrawal and reality. But that was the only way I was able to make it without taking the whole plane down and making an even bigger scene. Deep breathing and just digging so fucking deep and accepting this was my reality and I need to deal with it. But that plane ride was awful. Like the worst acid trip in the world and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. Then I had to drive 5 hours him which I managed to do solely because I knew I had more dope at home to save me. After about a half g to take me out of precip withdrawal I’m feeling good enough to look back and laugh and post this for anyone who is thinking of going on vacation …. Make sure you either have enough drugs or are already indicted on subs or risk being absolutely FUCKED by the hand of god or the devil or whoever punishes dope fiends like I was

Opiates bucket list?,"To keep it short- 

WHATS YOUR OPIATES BUCKET LIST?

(a list of opiates you would someone “recommend” to try) 

Hi guys, I am pretty new to opiates even though I am experienced with other drugs. Somehow I always had mad respect of opiates and avoided them, because my uncle was an addict and died of it. 

So now I old enough (27) to experiment here and there. 

I tried:
1. Poppy tea - did not understand the high
2. Codeine pills - did not understand the high
3. Tramadol - did not work for me
4. Codeine/DPH syrup- nice high, but not for the price…
5. Kratom (I know opioid , not opiate) - did not understand the high 
6. Oxy - surprisingly really nice high, but expensive where I live 

So apparently my body does not process opiates “well”, as I did not even feel high off most opiates I tried. Only oxy “worked” for me. People tell me, that I am lucky, that my body is like this. 

I was losing hope and thinking opiates are just not for me. But that oxy experience gave me hope. 

So besides things I’ve already tried , I wanna try someday:
1. Tilidin - most accessible where I live
2. “True” Opium - people from country of my origin just do cook it themselves and say it’s the best opiates you can get
3. Diaphin- medical grade heroin, might even happen someday, since I live in Europe 
4. Buprenorphine - some of my friends said, that’s the 🐐
5. Hydromorphone- lucky that I might get some, since friend gets its prescribed. 
6. Oxymorphone - tbh I think I’ll never get some, where I live, but maybe someday. 
7. O-DSMT - shits even legal and lab produced where I live, heard it’s even better than tramadol, since tramadol is metabolised to O-DSMT. 
8. Morphine - the OG
9. Omnopon - not even sure if it’s still being produced, but heard that’s a goat (to keep it short is a combination of different alcaloids)

I guess that’s my bucket list. What’s yours? What “would” you recommend 

PS. Does it make sense to keep naloxon around for my “experiments”?

Withdrawal Help,"Ok, so i've never done a post before so please bare with me.

Been on 30mg of oxy and 30mg of morphine sulf ER for 10 years. Started because of cancer and then continued with a pain clinic after the year of chemo. I've never bought illegally or done anything street related, every time i get a prior auth or back ordered medication i've dealt with it, done the withdrawal and go back once its available again. But god i'm tired guys... I'm tired of putting my life on hold, I got married during a prior auth and withdrawals. Should have been the happiest day of my life but i was so miserable.

Every time I stop, I make it 2-3 weeks without the medicine. The withdrawals aren't too bad, yeah im uncomfortable, I sneeze 50 times a day for weeks, diarrhea for weeks, low energy, cravings, you name it... but the worst is the sense of emptiness I feel. NOTHING and i mean NOTHING gives me joy. after 3 weeks of not being able to do anything i did before, i'm completely unable to keep myself off the meds. My favorite thing to do, me and my wife will game together. We have matching ""battle stations"" and pc game all the time. We've been doing it for 10 years, I don't take the medicine to get high, that hasn't happened in like 10 years since i started, i only take it to feel normal. I CANNOT play video games and enjoy myself. I cant sit through a movie. I get a small inkling of ""I should do this, it would be fun."" then as fast i got the feeling it vanishes and im not interested or cant enjoy it.

every time i go back to the medicine its like 21 days or so. Something hits me around 3 weeks, I just have fatigue. I miss video games, miss movies, miss doing fun things with my wife. It feels like i'll never be happy again.

TLDR: I guess my question is when will I feel happy again? I can't find fun in the things me and my wife used to do to relax. Should I try antidepressants? or should i not trade one medicine for another? I just wish their was a timeline on this, i truly want be normal again.",9,20,2025-01-12 17:34:52,withdrawal help ok 've never done post please bare 30mg oxy 30mg morphine sulf er 10 years started cancer continued pain clinic year chemo 've never bought illegally done anything street related every time get prior auth back ordered medication 've dealt done withdrawal go back available god 'm tired guys ...

Worth the effort?,"I am a chronic pain patient. And over the last year  I have had to travel for work more often. This leads me to reaching out to my doctor about an early refill. I then provide proof and she submits and puts on the script that I may refill early. 

Walgreens always has a issue with this and today they made me provide them proof, I asked the pharmacist (she wasn’t the one that put the note to make me show proof) and she stated she hasn’t seen anything like this. So
I provide my proof and I am good to go. 

Is it worth it to complain to the manager? My doctor has had no issues with my refills, just this one particular pharmacist at Walgreens has been giving me problems every time I had to pick them up. 

Thoughts ?

What is worse PWD or Narcan/Naloxone? ,"I've never had PWD, but I have been hit with narcan because I was overdosing on cf (I just smoked way too big of a bowl). And that was by far the most unpleasant feeling I've ever had. I've been through multiple major surgeries and really bad acid trips and benzo withdrawals.  But even when those are combined, the narcan took the cake when it came to pain and suffering. 

If you have experienced both PWD and naloxone/narcan(same thing, just differentways to be administered) , what would you say is worse?
I would assume that PWD is not as bad as narcan,  because if it's suboxone or methadone that causes the PWD than, that means you still have some sort of opioid on your opioid receptors, maybe it's not the same amount of opioids or type. But still, some receptors are being turned on. While with narcan,  it nearly strips all the opioids off of the receptors.  

Please elaborate.

The worst part about opiates for me,"Is when i have just enough that I need to save it.

I have no income, and nobody really that I can ask to buy me any or share with me. They're rare. Where I live, fent is the main drug, so if I wanted to get any for a reasonable price it's just be fent and that ain't my vibe. I also can't buy crypto, cuz I use an online bank account (I got scammed a while back and lost my bank, and can't easily get a new one for a couple years). 

So basically, if I want to use, I have to jump through a bunch of hoops or get really fuckin lucky, but the one friend I even have that does drugs with any consistency doesn't do opiates (I got my current bottle of hydros from them, they got some for free but they're on sublocade). 

--------

I'm down to 11 vicodin, 10/325, and I'm saving them for a rainy day, but goddamn I wish I could even get just like half a gram of (non-fent) h. I have such bad anxiety and unmanaged pain, and I wrestle with a bunch of shit that makes it hard to move half the time, but when I'm on ODSMT or Vicodin, I feel normal for a few hours. 

Clean, play games, make art, i can do whatever. I'm clear-headed, calm, empathetic. Usually it's really hard to have sex for me but when I'm on that cloud, it's pretty easy, and really fun. What I wouldn't give, just for a month's supply. I guess that's why they're so dangerous. 

That's all. Watching squid-game, and the prize money, and the episode 'Gganbu' got me thinkin. It's back to living sober for a while.

Propranolol seriously helps WD symptoms,"I heard about Propranolol from a friend about it reducing WD symptoms. I was naturally skeptical but it really does work. I was averaging around 300mg a day of pharma oxy and when I’d run out I’d have severe WD’s. I would be so anxious/agitated that I couldn’t even sit down, I’d just walk in laps around the house. I’d be pouring sweat even with the aircon blaring at 20°C (68°F).

I tried taking 40mg of propranolol one day when having severe WD’s and within an hour they all but disappeared. It got rid of at least 90% of my WD symptoms. I could sit still and watch TV and my anxiety was greatly reduced. I wasn’t bucketing sweat and I felt almost human. If 40mg doesn’t work you can bump it up to 80mg.

If you combine this with Imodium (loperamide) for the diarrhoea and Buscopan (hyoscine butylbromide) for the stomach pains then you can ride out your WD’s with minimal discomfort. I came off 300mg of pharma oxy a day and with this combo my WD’s were reduced by at least 80-90%.

You’ll need a prescription for propranolol in most places but just find an online/phone doctor and tell them your usual doctor gives it to you for high blood pressure (make sure you’re honest with them about any medications you’re taking and your medical history to ensure it’s safe for you to take). Most doctors will give it to you without hesitation as it’s not a controlled medication and it’s relatively safe to take.

For anyone wondering about getting started DON’T,"The past 2 years have been terrible every day has a knew challenge or symptom. I started taking hydrocodone around October of 2023 it quickly spiraled into a poly substance addiction. I have always smoked weed that’s nothing new however every substance I mention in this post this was my first major exposure to them! I started for quite a few reasons to keep it short for this post one of the main reasons I was I had an accident and most of my tooth was gone exposing the nerve to the elements! The pain wasn’t terrible it was just the lack of sleep and how uncomfortable I always felt. So occasionally I would take 10mg of hydrocodone to help with those problems quickly I realized why people threw their lives away for a pill and it became a very common thing for me to do 10 went to 20,40,60 etc you get it. I was always chasing that original high never achieved that!! After around a year of of jumping face first into the realm of drugs I went to the psych ward. 

For two weeks I experienced withdrawals from opioids,opiates,benzos while I was in the hospital. I thought that’s this would be the first and last time I’d ever experience those feelings. I had willingly gone and seriously wanted to turn my life around but I wasn’t ready. Quickly after getting out started stockpiling substances as I was taking 12 of Suboxone for several months. Two months of Suboxone withdrawal later I was back at it it’s been around 3 months since I quite. I used Xanax and Valium during those few months this is important because when I started again my benzo tolerance was decent nothing crazy tho. As I got back into my routine of taking drugs my tolerance went right back to where it was and I thought maybe it’s the benzos well I decided cold turkey them and fuck me was that a bad idea. So a few more weeks of just lots of anxiety and stress. This whole time I’ve been prescribed quite a few different medications None of which were opioids or benzos! I was on Prozac,clonidine and Seroquel throughout most this time about a week ago I had to stop taking my Seroquel.

Cocaine sold as fent?? ,"So a little backstory, I'm fairly new to the ""raw fentanyl"" scene but have been doing the pressed 30s/BTH for years. I recently started doing the raw just because it was easier on my nose than snorting a bunch of pills throughout the day.. 

I bought a gram of supposed ""fent"" today, and when I got home and did a line it smelled just like coke, the drip tasted like coke, and the powder almost shined like coke. Has anyone else ever had this happen to them? Is there fentanyl out there that smells like coke and I just haven't had it yet?  It just doesn't seem very cost effective to say you're going to sell a g of fent but actually sell them coke. isn't coke more expensive?

It would never happen to me...Loperamide post,"I have seen a couple of posts on here lately that reference people being on loperamide/ immodium and I wanted to give you an account of my experience. 



I will never forget the day I discovered Immodium. I read all this stuff about it on the forums back in 2014-15 era and decided to do some research on Wikipedia. 

  
ChemSpider data...Discovered in....oh there it is!! Drug class -

  
Drug Class- Opioid Agonist. 

  
Opioid?! 

  
I thought this \*mimicked\* opioids? I thought it was an opioid that didnt cross the blood brain barrier, which made it sort of less of an opioid? I did not realize I was dealing with a full fledged Opioid agonist. 

  
A few days later, it was a wednesday, and I got paid Thurdsay. I decided to go down to the local publix and steal a couple of boxes of Immodium. I knew that I had to take quite a few, so I really over did it. I took 60 pills of Immodium. 

  
As I hung out on my couch browsing reddit, the familiar opioid warmth took a hold of me. My eyes got tighter, I was scratching my nose more. Smoking cigarettes every ten minutes. But I did not know what I was in for until the next day. 

  
The next morning I woke up and was high as a kite!! Full blown opioid high!! I thought I had discovered the holy grail. A legal opiod that could be stolen, that gave me a legitimate high was available at every single grocery store in my city. They say that it does not pass the blood brain barrier...Ah yes, this is true if taken in minimal amounts. If you take a lot...in my experience 50 or more pills...It definitely crosses the BBB. 

  
Time went by, I used it as a crutch, until I found myself in rehab. Times had gotten bad, I had a schedule 1 drug arrest under my belt and was legally mandated to a rehab. The dope had turned into fentanyl by this time (2018) and when I entered my mandated treatment, it didnt take 60 pills to get me high...it took 200. 



Days turned into weeks in this facility, weeks turned into months and by month 3 of this place I was taking 300 (yes 300) immodium pills per day. I was about 30 pounds overweight, I was nodding out at my desk at cushy office job where people didn't nod out, I was getting these electrical zaps in my body that would shake my arms and legs violently and my skin was extremely dry from the immodium induced dehydration. Also, I was drinking about 2 gallons of water a day to keep myself hydrated. My coworkers would make comments to me like ""bro I have NEVER seen someone drink that much water...you might need to get yourself looked at"" , "" Do you have diabetes man?"" 



One day, a Friday, I was walking across the office and felt a shock and a sense of impending doom. Thats the only way I know how to describe it. IT stopped me in my tracks, I still remember where I wa standing in that office when it happened. Like... I all of a sudden knew something bad was going to happen and went into a panic. The whole rest of the day I felt off...I felt like something was about to go really wrong. 

  
 I had heard all of these problems with immodium and heart issues...I was constantly checking my pulse over the course of these months. This night I checked my pulse like normal...nothing.No, I mean I couldnt feel anything, there was not a pulse to be found. I began to panic, I did not have a pulse. I would press my fingers to my neck, feel where my heart is on my chest, and couldnt feel anything!! I booked an appointment for a suboxone doctor the next day. 

  
I go to the appointment the next day and on the way home from the pharmacy, I am walking to the top of a hill and feel myself blacking out, it felt like tunnel vision.  ""Uh oh- somethings wrong"", I said. I called my girlfriend and she comes to see me. I put on her apple watch....164 BPM- not good. 

  
We sped down to the hospital, They rush me inside and do an EKG, my shits haywire. Ventricular Tachycardia. The try multiple medicines, one stops your heart and restarts it, (feels like shooting coke without euphoria), and another one. Nothing was working. Doctors were running around, my bed was surrounded by 10-15 doctors and nurses. They had a look of panic on their face. 

  
They rushed me up to ICU and began to explain things, 

  
""Sir, I dont know if you understand whats going on, but its not looking good. You should call your family and tell them to come see you. We will be doing a cardioversion in a few minutes"" 

  
I declined to call my family. 

""Sir...I dont think you understand...Call your family now"" 

  
Again I declined. 

  
I always thought they would be more nice and understanding like in the movies. They were all very matter of fact and told my what I didn't want to hear. 

They told me they were giving me fentanyl citrate and would induce the cardioversion, which honestly, I was stoked on. 

3...2....1...and oblivion. 

  
beep....................beep...................beep....................beep 

  
I woke up to a smiling nurse 

""It worked like a charm. Your pulse rate is a 59. You need to thank whatever God you believe in because you really pulled out of that one :)""



The next few days were spent getting an ultrasound of my heart, a MRI of my heart and some blood work. As it turned out, I dont have any major problems from it. The fact that I was able to procure 60 suboxone right before my heart issue ensured that I would be relatively well and not dopesick during my stay in ICU. Although, 24 mg of suboxone did nothing to alleviate my knee pain, runny nose, lack of sleep, and general malaise. Immodium is powerful stuff! 

  
I don't know if its my nature or what, but I always thought I was bulletproof. I never thought it would happen to me. I kept saying that I would stop using immodium eventually/ I would quit before some serious problem happened, but I got caught up. I was extremely arrogant. I have never been narcanned (through 13 years of addictive addiction) and I always have felt like I could beat anything. I think its my nature. 

  
One other thing- If youre asking yourself why I didnt go to the hospital the night where I couldnt feel my heart....IDK!! I felt like it would go away or something. I felt like If I got on suboxone the next day it would fix the problem. I was mandated to this rehab and felt like if I told them I was using something they would get me locked up again. This was very stupid on my part but its how I felt in this moment. If I had to do it over again, I wouldve gone to the ER. I am lucky to be alive and think if I wasnt in great shape at the time, I would have died. 

  
If you are megadosing immodium, stop right now and go to a methadone clinic or get on suboxone. 

  
If you are megadosing immodium and you are doing so because you're in sober living, tell your therapist whats going on and go back to detox. I think this is super common. People use immodium because it doesnt show up on piss tests.  I know in my case, I felt like I couldnt tell anyone because I would go back to jail. If I had to do it over again, I would tell someone before it EVER got to be that bad. 

  
I have a buddy, Justin, that died from this shit. He was sitting on the couch next to his wife and ended up passing away. He didn't get to the hospital before he died. 



There is somebody reading this post right now that is laughing saying ""diharrea pills HAHA!! who the fuck gets addicted to that shit!!""

There is another person reading this post that is helplessly strung out on this shit and doesn't know how to quit, knows the risks but doesn't think it will happen to them. Please get off this shit. It is only a matter of time before you end up in the hospital fighting for your life like me. 



I am a former IV heroin and fentanyl addict. I was addicted to OCs and Opanas. I have been there, done that. I was not some kid trying to get high off ""legal drugs"" because couldnt find real ones. And there was a time during this that immodium and its high became such a part of my life, I would choose it over heroin, because I could maintain a normal life on it as well as afford it. YES, you heard that correctly, There was a time when I loved immodium so much that I would have chosen it over other opioids. 

  
But at the end of the day this is an extremely dangerous substance, please....leave this shit alone. 




Edit: one other thing I forgot to add- I began failing for methadone at my rehab. It would pop on the cup, and then be confirmed negative at the lab. So, if you do it enough, you will pop for methadone.

Parents can always tell when I'm high on oxy because.... ,"Typically I'm quiet and introverted. Especially the last few months because I've been suffering with bad depression.

For me oxy feels like a stimulant without the negative effects of a stim like racing heart, anxiety, comedown etc. I feel like it's impossible to feel depressed while I'm high.

"Opioid induced urinary retention, any tips?","Hi, I have chronic pain and I use more or less 600 mg of Morphine (IV) a day, I don't have any problems and I tolerate it well, as always I have constipation which I manage with PAMORA (Naldemedine, Naloxegol) and I am also on Memantine 20 mg which helps with tolerance.

"People who have taken tapentadol, what is it like? Is it very different from other opioids or nah?","Hello everyone! I have experience with tramadol, codeine, morphine and also hydrocodone a couple times. With my current tolerance, it takes about 50mg morphine for me to get a decent high. I can function as normal, and most people can't tell that I'm on something at all. I always use for work hours or to go do stuff outside in general.

As of now I have access to tapentadol 50mg tabs, so i wonder: is it much different from ""regular"" opioids? Can you function well on it? And how hideable is it? I have concerns because when googling this topic, I've read comments about hallucinations, and also a significant degree (almost benzo-esque) of analysis suppresion, which never happens to me on any other opioids. But I also find good experiences. Anyway, idk about taking it this without asking first.

Looking for feedback/advice on my detox plan. ,"
SORRY THIS IS LONG I HAVE INCLUDED A SIGN XX SO YOU CAN SKIP SOME STUFF IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE READING THIS NOVEL OF A POST TO GET TO THE ACTUAL PLAN WITHOUT MY LIFE STORY

So I have tried and failed to get clean about 10 times the past year. I have been on and off mostly just dope for the past 6 years. In November my of 2018 my Mom and brother died in a car wreck. So I went from a “here and there” user to all the time. Recently since my last dope start date (Dec of 2023) the longest I made it was 5 days and that was because I flew out of town and was scarfing down kratom the whole time. Second best I ever got was 72 hours.

I wanted to get clean over Christmas break. But someone stole my script of Xanax and I didn't have any other comfort meds.

But now I do, so while I don't have 2 weeks I've got three days lol. But I've got IMO quite the nice stack of prescription comfort meds and supplements. So here is my plan. (well skip down to the two X's if you don't want all the extra dope boy back story BS)

Tried to tapper since Saturday, didn't go exactly as planned. Here's why: I do have 4 dope boys and one has that tranq dope, and he sells for $60 a g so I was going to him when I was poor. That was until I nodded out on a new job I finally got and got for after two weeks (well that wasn't the only reason but it was 80% of it. They legit thought it was an ""untreated sleep disorder"" because I don't ""look like a junkie"" and passed my initial drug test with fake pee. So I got my last good paycheck for them, bought one more ball and wallowed in my misery for 5 days or so and never went back. So I haven't hit him up since 11/12. Other dude wise; I have your typical cut and fent guy. One guy is hit or miss with either his shit being pretty weak or solid (REAL H not fent). Then there's my always shit dude. He has solid chunks of real dope in there (not fent) but this POS always cuts his shit by like 75%. I know it's shit to give this guy business. Because the hit or miss guy only cuts his shit bad when his supply gets low. But guy two is like I said hit or miss, you might get a great bag, you might get a bag that's 90% cut. And right now I am fixing to quit this HAS to be it. I am flying out of state for 2 weeks straight in 11 days from tomorrow and Kratom is illegal where I am going. So I went with the 75% cut dude since Sat. I used to rotate the 3 guys just whoever answered with the shit dope guy being my least favorite. But I have been using JUSt him on purpose since sat. I have been breaking down the chunks and mixing it. So why it's not exactly a tapper, I am not randomly getting good bags from hit or miss dude or getting fent from my fave dude. I tried to do a little less but it was too hard with my job. So idk if you can call that a tapper. Maybe cutting down? 


Whatever enough rambling. I started a new job 11/18 and this job is a manual labor job where I work 10 hour days 4 day t as(7:30-6pm) so I have 3 days off. 

XX (skip to hear if you didn't want to read all the extra BS)

Since I don't have two weeks and only have 3 days. I really did stack up on the comfort meds and supplements. 

OTC supplements I started Tuesday. Ester-C (not megadosing but am taking more than the bottle recommends, I am taking double the daily recommend dose) DLPA 2 caps in the morning 2 caps in the evening, Agmatine Sulfate (same regimen as DLPA) and BSO (have the liquid and gel caps. I am doing one gel tabs twice a day.

For the food (er well nutrition) during detox I bought 3 6-packs of Ensure, two regular ones and one high protein one. I also bought some liquid IV stuff to add to water and 4 Gatorades brand of the Pedialyte drinks. 

For prescription comfort meds I have two subs, Fifthteen 1mg kpins, two 2mg Xanbars, five 600mg gabapentin, 2 Adderall (don't know the amount)

The plan is to do my usual line before work and during lunch. And as soon as I get in my car to go home instead of a line, do a small final bump, just because it takes me 30 minutes to go home with no traffic, with it, it can sometimes take up to an hour, so I don't want to be sick in that. This bump WON'T get me high, hell it's so small I will probably only make me feel ""mostly well"" but I know my body and how it reacts to that amount.

So last small dose Thursday around 6 PM and no more. Gonna try to hold off on comfort meds as much as possible (only taking supplements 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

So last dose of dope around 6 PM Thurs. I was gonna take .75 of a sub Monday morning at 5:30 AM Monday. (then .5 Tues and Wed and then .25 Thurs. The goal was to rough it out the next weekend. And the addys were for work the following week (not whole things, small pieces because my energy will still be low) I will have my xanax script by then so if the anxiety and heart palpations should be addressed.

Is it possible for oxycodone to trigger an epileptic seizure? ,"Is it possible for oxycodone to trigger an epileptic seizure?

I recently had a convulsive seizure in the middle of the street with no triggers, I had taken an oxy 20mg 2h, before, (while it was a period where I was taking 40 - 60 mg every day so I had some tolerance).

I know that oxy is stimulating and that you have to use it with caution if you have epilepsy, but I don't have epilepsy, I'm 20 years old and this kind of thing has never happened to me. And i NEVER ever heard that someone got an convulsive seizure due to oxy. Plus, I've taken many drugs in my life that were much more likely to trigger an epileptic seizure, such as stims or tramadol in large quantities.

That thing scares me a lil bit so if someone knows about all that i'd love an explanation cuz im scared that it could happen again at any moment.",1,2,2025-01-09 21:38:53,possible oxycodone trigger epileptic seizure possible oxycodone trigger epileptic seizure recently convulsive seizure middle street triggers taken oxy 20mg 2h period taking 40 60 mg every day tolerance know oxy stimulating use caution epilepsy n't epilepsy 'm 20 years old kind thing never happened never ever heard someone got convulsive seizure due oxy plus 've taken many drugs life much likely trigger epileptic seizure stims tramadol large quantities thing scares lil bit someone knows 'd love explanation cuz im scared could happen moment

How is possible that I’m negative to oxycodone in a urine test when I literally took it 12 hours before?,"Hi guys, so basically I’m entering to Rehab and quit my addiction to opioids, I’m using oxycodone (oxycontin 80mg (x4) daily) and sometimes percocet (20/325 (x6) daily). To entering in rehab and start a treatment like methadone or suboxone they have to verify if you’re actually using those substances, so this morning I went to the clinic, I did an urine test (the fast one that shows in 5/10min the results) and I tested negative in all the opiates and opioids (heroin, morphine, codeine, buprenorphine, methadone, and other opioids/opiates substances, but oxy was not on the list for example), so they sent my sample to the laboratory to have a deeper analysis. My question is how is that even possible? I mean, I use oxy since a year every day (real OxyContin from pharmacy for those who are wondering) and my last dose was literally 12 hours before the test.
 (I always take oxy intranasal, but that shouldn’t be an issue since it always metabolize through your kidneys, or for example, substances like cocaine do results but their roa is intranasal.)
In 5 days, I’m going back again to do another test to make sure again, but do you guys know how chemically is possible that my test was negative? Is it because oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid and it has something to do with other substances which are not included in the test like I don’t know heroin?

What are your thoughts? In which category should the OxyCodone results positive? Morphine?

Threw almost four years clean down the drain. Put some sense into my head,"Back in 2020, I went to rehab after a year long OC80 habit. At the end I ate three to four of those blue fuckers a day, it was terrible. I did the whole nine yards: got clean, moved cities, went to university, got a prestigious internship and finished my bachelors thesis with highest grades. All great, everybody so proud, but all along I was feeling like shit. I was young when I went to rehab, and I was in such a rush to get out in the world and prove everybody wrong that I didn't gave two fucks about what caused my addictive behaviour. 

Some months back, in June, I started taking benzodiazepines, I guess it was for anxiety symptoms. i never did it to get high, only in normal doses per se. Don't think I've ever taken over 40mg diazepam over 24 hrs. I made a deal with myself: hand in your bachelor thesis in December, then seek help. And that's what I did. I'm in the midst of a taper with my local addiction center, and on that front it's great something is being done. They might even offer me some therapy.

A few weeks back, although, life took unexpected turns. I was crushed, emotionally and financially. I bought an OC80, did 40mg, saved 40mg for the day after and nodded the fuck out for two days. The warm blanket felt exactly the way I remembered it. I know why I did it, but I regret it just as much as taking that first benzo back in June.

It was in the mid of December, today is January 8th, and I just did it for I think the tenth time or something like that. The 20mg don't get me nodding anymore, 40mg barely does. I can go two to three days, sensing no withdrawals, but then I do them again. As mentioned, this has been going on for some weeks.

I went to this sub for so much advice, support and comfort back in 2020 and 2021 when I was in active addiction and in my recovery phase. Now I'm on the steps of a nasty oxy habit again. Apparently, I can't get into my head what it is I'm doing. I did around 50mg tonight, and I plan of doing the rest. It will be the last pill, but I said that the last time and the last time again.

This may sound so fucking dumb, but please, someone, remind me why we don't do this shit. Remind me why this is the direct pathway to misery. Remind that I'm better than this. Remind me there's still a turning point without going through the whole nine yards again.

Tramadol is underrated asf,"Tramadol is very underrated an is commonly tagged as garbage, but IMO is only garbage when you have tolerance like me, only thing I get is the antidepressant properties 

Since I was 19 I started takin trams and now I’m 22 and still using it daily 

If you have zero tolerance this shit will get you nodding out with 200-300 mg 

Also it has antidepressant qualities and it feels so good, some people can’t feel too much because they body can’t process the tram properly 

But if you have luck and you can process the trams 

It’s the best feeling I know of 

At 400mg> it’s dangerous due to the seizure risk 

But if you take benzos with it, you’ll be fine 

And you can dose much higher along with kpins.

I already tried codeine, morphine and tapentadol

And I loved morphine and tapentadol too

But I still prefer tramadol only cause the SSRIs properties

Do cravings EVER go away?,"I've used all kinds of opiates/oids for a looong time now stemming from getting annihilated in an accident.

We need to legalize opium,"For centuries, opium was openly used to treat life-threatening conditions like dysentery—no Narcan, no modern medicines, and yet no societal collapse. In fact, this access to a potent, natural remedy helped countless people survive severe illness and increased overall life expectancy. Now, despite all our medical advancements and overdose-reversal drugs, we’re witnessing unprecedented opioid-related deaths—directly tied to strict criminalization that drives opium (and stronger synthetic opioids) underground. Legalizing opium simply acknowledges a proven historical reality: societies prospered, lives were saved, and harm remained low when opium wasn’t demonized or forced into illicit channels. If we truly care about preventing overdoses, keeping patients safe, and preserving personal freedom, the straightforward answer is to stop criminalizing a natural medicine that has served humanity for millennia.

I find it ironic that people think if we were to legalize opium that addiction rates will soar and society will crumble. Yet that never happened in ancient Greece or ancient Rome or any other society that flourished while having legal opium markets.

Google/Wikipedia rabbit hole left me with a question ,"If I made a tea/extract made from some species (not somniferum, I'm not risking that) of poppy, gently heated until reduced (basically concentrated), and then gently heated in vinegar for some time, would that result in acetylated morphine derivatives? I was reading about 'compote', which is basically what I just described but made from somniferum poppy straw/seed tea (yes, I'm aware of the fermented fruity compote drink, I'd like to make that, too, someday). If i did the same with non somniferum poppies, would it work? I may try it if no one knows since I can turn the final product into a tea to slowly sip on. 

TL;DR: Would decorative poppies work to make acetylated morphine tea using vinegar, water/ethanol, and heat? Or just ordinary poppy tea?

Favourite syringe brand to use?,"Im extremely fussy when it comes to using my rig, I find it next to impossible to hit a vein with everything other than ones made by m devices, used to be called Mulitgate.

When I go to pick up my box from the injecting rooms I always have to point out which ones on the shelf they are & then continue to tell me im one of the very few people to use them.

Most people stick to BD or Trumeo, both of which I find utterly useless, extremely blunt and lead to me turning my self into a human pin cushion. Also the multigates have this handy feature where as when you pull on the device to suck the water up the plunger won't simply slide out out the top it requires a good tug to get the plunger out. Caus its always a bitch when your doing your hit up and in haste you pull the whole damn plunger out while trying to get those drugs inside it loll.

Im in Australia so the brands may differ in your part of the world although im sure they are all made in china.

So fellow IV opiate users what is your go to brand, do you have a reason as to why? I've noticed most people just stick to whatever the old vending machines would spit out back in the day.... but now we live in the future of syringe choices! Exciting times to be alive lol.

How was the downfall into addiction like for you guys,"OK, so I’m going to start this out by saying I don’t plan on doing opioids ever again(I’ve only done codeine a few times early last year) and I am asking more for a friend

I am trying to convince a friend not to do oxy(for a variety of reasons like it ruining lives and tolerance = harder time for when you ACTUALLY need it), he told me that it’s gonna be a once and done deal but I have a hard time believing that since he previously had problem with other less problematic substances

So I got some questions for you guys(specifically ones who are in active addiction or recovery, and started recreationally):
1. When before you first took oxy/any opioids, did you view it as a once and done deal or were you like viewing it as something something you’ll do once a month or did you view it as something you did regularly

2. How was your relationship with other substances(like were you able to control yourself with other substances you used)

3. If you were having problems with other substances before hand, how does it compare to opioid addiction

4. What made opioids special to you

5. Do you regret ever touching opioids

6. Did opioid addiction affect you in various ways, like financially or socially

These are the questions I can currently think of, but you can go more in depth on your descent into opioid addiction 

I genuinely just don’t want my friend going into opioids, and I’m trying to convince him to just dispose of your oxys and not to even touch them

Can any of you give me some insight on your guy’s experiences

Need some advice for my pain. ,"25yr old male, broke both legs twice, flipped a racecar terribly in 2019 and now my back is worse of all. It’s getting unbearable. I was hooked on Roxy at 16 from my broke leg (unintentionally) and have been on kratom past 4 years. Made me quit drinking, and quality of life greatly improved. However I was naive to kratom and got up to 80gpd without even thinking about it. Back in may tapered down to 15gpd overnight and successfully down to nothing in a month. Pain has been too bad for work (diesel mechanic) so I have been on 8-10g of kratom for last 4 months and it’s been alright other than at night after work or when weather is cold. I have RSD, neuropathy, and althritis. Kava helps great at night. Drs don’t want to do surgery till I’m 30 since I require both knee replacements. I have a great dr and she pretty much told me my body is that of a 80 year old. She will write me hydros or percoset easily, and if I absolutely have to I can responsibly manage that for 5 years. However, I was wondering if suboxone would be a better option? I’m literally just looking for something to dull this constant 8.5/10 pain that I feel everyday, and to not crave anything and just feel normal. I want a steady line not ups and downs. I’m not doing pain management. Would super low dose suboxone be the answer? Thank you all.

I’m writing something and am trying to describe dope sickness to someone who’s never experienced it,"Would love some feedback…did I forget anything?

Lots of people compare it to the worst flu you’ve ever had—I disagree. It’s not just being sick; it’s like your body is betraying you, turning every moment into an excruciating eternity. For most—including myself—it starts with uncontrollable yawning, the biggest yawns you’ve ever had, coming relentlessly every few seconds. Your eyes water until tears stream down your face, and your jaw starts to ache from the constant stretching. But these aren’t normal yawns—they’re the first sign that something is seriously wrong, like your body is trying to expel something it can’t reach.

Then comes this creeping anxiety that won’t go away. It claws at your mind and makes your heart race as if you’re being chased—but you know you can’t run because the horror is coming from inside you. The panic is paired with a deep, gnawing dread, like every bit of hope has been drained from your soul.

Next, there’s the sweating. Hot one minute, freezing the next. You’ll be drenched and shivering at the same time, your skin crawling with an unbearable sensation, like bugs burrowing beneath it. You can’t get comfortable—ever. Your legs, arms, everything aches, throbs, or twitches uncontrollably. Even lying still feels like torture because your muscles won’t stop screaming for relief.

You’d think you might get relief when you go to sleep, right? Wrong. You’ll toss and turn all night, wide awake, trying every possible position to find one that’s comfortable. It doesn’t matter how cozy you try to make it—you’ll feel every fiber of every blanket and sheet against your skin. It’s either too soft and tickles, too itchy, or too rough. It’s too hot with blankets and too cold without them. You’ll want to be naked, but if your clammy skin rubs against itself, it’ll send shivers throughout your body. Occasionally, you might pass out for a few minutes, but it’s not real rest—it’s more like your brain glitches out from exhaustion before waking you up in a panic, like the feeling you get when you wake up hours late for work.

You won’t be able to eat or drink either, thanks to the constant nausea and cramps. If you do manage to choke anything down, it’ll likely come right back up or go straight through you. It’s like your guts are in open rebellion. Between not being able to keep anything down, the diarrhea, and the constant need to pee, you become dangerously dehydrated and malnourished. Pair that with lack of sleep, and you turn into a complete zombie, stuck in a nightmarish state of delirium.

All your senses become so intense it feels like your brain might short-circuit. The lights are too bright, everything smells and tastes too strong, every touch is painful, and every sound is too loud. Your emotions become completely out of control and unmanageable. You’ll cry out of nowhere—sobbing, snot running down your face—feeling like the most pathetic creature alive. Every regret, every mistake, every ounce of shame you’ve ever felt comes rushing in, drowning you in guilt.

 And then there’s the need—this overwhelming, all-consuming urge that screams in your mind. It insists that one small action will end the nightmare. You don’t just think about it—you feel it in every fiber of your being, like survival itself depends on it. The worst part? You know that giving in only resets the cycle, but enduring another endless minute, hour, or day feels equally impossible.

Once you’re more than a day into it you can’t even do anything to try and fix it. the only way you’ll get relief is if someone helps you. You can’t hustle at that point. I’ve been so sick and seen people so sick that can’t even talk let alone walk. Even if you do get more dope somehow you are so shaky, you can barely even do it without assistance. When you’re in such absolute rough shape, reduced to just a leaky, disgusting delirious shell of a person,  very few people will want to have anything to do with you let alone help you.

Is there a way to use tapentodal that doesn’t suck?,"
TLDR: taps have been a huge disappointment. See below diss I’ve tried. Should I mix soma to make it better? Anything more than 100 I get loopy.

Thought I’d give this a try it was cheap from outside the US and said what the hell. I hear people saying euphoria akin to oxys. 

My experience so far is you get a tiny window of euphoria then I just feel weird.  And it makes me just want to nod and I hallucinate in a way. I loved oxys because they gave me a boost of energy. These are opposite plus it kinds fucks with your balance. 


I’ve tried 100mg dose, 200, and 400. I can function with 100 but it doesn’t give much recreational value. 

I’ve got somas on the way I’ve never tried. Maybe mixing them? I can’t be so loopy. Maybe it’s just a shit drugs and I’ll put it in the back of my cabinet for if I need a sleep pill lol.

Accidently used cocaine instead of Dope.,"I accidentally injected cocaine instead of heroin. I had just bought 6 bags total—5 bundled together and 1 loose bag. Since I often receive it like this, I didn’t think twice.

My usual method is IV injection, so I prepped my dose by combining the loose bag with 3 from the bundle, cooked it, and filtered it into a syringe. I hit a vein on the first try, which was rare for me. Expecting the familiar rush, I knew something was wrong within seconds—a loud ringing filled my head, and a powerful surge swept from my toes to my head. That’s when it hit me: This was cocaine.

I hadn’t used cocaine since 2015, and even then, only snorted it a few times. But I recognized the feeling immediately. Panic set in as I realized I had just IV’d 4 bags with no tolerance. I was shaking uncontrollably, fumbling to call my dealer, who I’ve known since 2016. When she finally answered, I whispered, 'You gave me coke, not heroin! Did you know?' She was extremely apologetic and reassured me that only the loose bag was cocaine, not the entire batch. And she had accidently mixed 1 bag with the 5 of mine when putting it together.

Relief washed over me. I genuinely thought I was going into cardiac arrest. I was even praying, thinking it might be the end for me. This experience taught me a hard lesson: Always test your supply. Complacency can be deadly. If the whole batch had been cocaine, I might not be here to tell this story.

Sorry for the long post—I'm still feeling the effects, as this just happened 45 minutes ago.

"scary experience, no one to talk to irl","hi, new to the sub, nice to meet yall 👋
my wife and i have been occasional H users for the past couple of years. two nights ago around 3am, my wife was breathing loudly and strangely and moving around a lot, which thankfully woke me up. she was conscious but extremely disoriented, cross eyed, and said she felt like she was dying. i was half awake and very confused because as far as i knew, we had gone to bed at the same time (around three hours prior) and therefore she wouldn’t have taken anything recently because we were asleep. i gave her narcan and she very quickly went back to normal, color came back into her lips, breathing normally and everything. she fell back asleep and i stayed up to monitor her. in the morning she didn’t remember anything. she had no memory of taking anything during the night. a few months ago she started sleepwalking randomly for the first time in her life, and we haven’t been able to figure out what is causing it. currently the theory for the other night is that she managed to take the H while sleepwalking (she has managed to roll and smoke cigarettes while fully asleep so i wouldn’t be surprised) and obviously didn’t know what she was doing because she was asleep, and took too much. so now i have to hide it from her when she goes to sleep. it’s the first time we’ve ever had any kind of close call like that and it’s really been stressful for me, i can’t stop ruminating about it. it doesn’t help that i can’t talk about it with people irl since no one really knows that we are users. if i hadn’t woken up i don’t know what would have happened.

Anyone else think or say crazy shit when high?,I don't know if I am just a weirdo or what it is but I am wondering if other people experience this. When I am on opioids frequently I have pretty crazy or way out of pocket thoughts. Sort of like intrusive thoughts or like thinking of saying something highly inappropriate either generally or for the situation. I'm sure it lowers my inhibitions a little but not as much as like benzos or alcohol. I usually don't say these things to others though for obvious reasons. If I'm fucked up on an opioid I feel like I fixate on things which then make a cycle of continuously having the out of pocket thoughts. I know this is kind of weird I promise I'm not severely mentally ill it's just on opioids lol especially ones that give you a nice energy boost. Amounts and types of opioids that make you nod off obviously are less prone to this sort of thing. Just wondering if others have a similar situation ever. ,12,33,2025-01-05 06:36:51,anyone else think say crazy shit high n't know weirdo wondering people experience opioids frequently pretty crazy way pocket thoughts sort like intrusive thoughts like thinking saying something highly inappropriate either generally situation 'm sure lowers inhibitions little much like benzos alcohol usually n't say things others though obvious reasons 'm fucked opioid feel like fixate things make cycle continuously pocket thoughts know kind weird promise 'm severely mentally ill 's opioids lol especially ones give nice energy boost amounts types opioids make nod obviously less prone sort thing wondering others similar situation ever

10 years ago... anyone still here from back then?,"I try to come here once a year to share my brother's story. It's cathartic for me, and I sincerely hope helpful for anyone struggling and wanting to get clean. 

10 years ago I was visiting my family in NJ. We were going to spend the holidays with my family. It was lovely. My brother seemed to be doing great. He was playing with my kids and laughing and having such a great time.  He had supposedly been clean for a few months at this point. On Wednesday he told us he wanted to really make a change, because even though he wasn't using he felt stuck. He said he wanted to come to church with my family that upcoming Sunday. And maybe he would finally take me up on my offer for him to come live with us for a while. There was a really toxic situation between him and our dad. 

On Friday we were all going to go this dinosaur event with animatronic dinosaurs or whatever. For the kids. But that morning he said he was going to meet up with someone to play disc golf instead. We all went to the dinosaur thing. Came home, normal day, but never heard from my brother. As the night got later my mom was freaking out. I really didn't believe the worst could have happened. Even when my brother was using he told me he was a ""smart user"" and not like those ""other dumbasses"". I've never used opiates before, so words like ""test shot"" and whatever he did to ensure his safety went over my head.  I assumed maybe he met some girl and was staying with her. 

Then the next day came and went, with no word or sign from him. At this point my parents had tried to file a police report, but a 28 year old missing man wasn't high on anyone's priority list aside from ours. 

He had a tablet at the time, and I decided to look at his history. He was on Reddit all the time. Specifically this sub every single day. At this time I had never heard of Reddit. I created an account (username makes sense now?) and posted here, probably breaking all sorts of rules but the mods were really nice and let it slide. Many, many redditors reached out with great advice, and some even volunteered to call hospitals and police stations for me. (Unfortunately I was not tech savvy at the time, and I didn't know how to see what my brother's username was. I wish I did, though I think he was definitely more of a lurker than a poster.)

Another day and sleepless night passed and I started to agree with my mom, something bad must have happened.  We looked at his EZ Pass charges and saw the last charge was in Newark on Friday. We drove all around Newark, but didn't see him or his car anywhere. All the calls redditors were making for me weren't turning up any leads either. We went home, still trying to convince ourselves that maybe he took off with some ex-gf or something. But when we got home, just a few minutes later, two detectives from Newark NJ came knocking on the door.

They told us that they found a body they suspected was my brother. They told us he was dead, probably for a few days based on the condition of his body. They thought he was a homeless John Doe, because instead of helping him, someone stole his wallet. Since I was visiting from out of town my brother let me use his bedroom, and he put a lot of his stuff in his car, creating this situation that made it appear like he had been living out of his car for some time. Really he was staying with family, but was keeping clothes and personal things in his car.

I'm assuming he was robbed after he died because his car looked trashed, his wallet was missing along with expensive hockey gear, and dog grooming tools. I'd like to get angry at whoever decided to rob his dead body instead of trying to get help, but really I can't imagine living a life where you're so desensitized to seeing a body like that you don't think twice about taking whatever's valuable.

My brother was a single, 28 year old man. I don't think he felt like he had any really close friends, was estranged from our dad, and I imagine that he never dreamed his death would matter much anyway. He couldn't have been more wrong. It's been 10 years and we are still devastated. The entire family that used to be so close has completely shattered. I'm the oldest, and our baby sister is just a shell of herself. Our brother was her person, and losing him sent her into a spiral, I'm not sure she'll ever find her way out. My mom doesn't speak to her sisters, and all the cousins that were once like siblings are splintered.

  
The truth is, I thought this would get easier with time. But siblings are supposed to be there to age with you. I turned 40 last year. My brother should be 38, and we should be talking about our aging parents together. He should be the fun amazing uncle to my kids. He should have his own family that he wanted. He would have been such a good dad. Please, if you think no one would care if you died, think again. The ripple effect is unreal.

  
I'm sorry this is getting so long. I just wanted to share one more part of the story. My brother's best friend from high school came to our house as soon as he found out. I don't remember the last time they saw each other, but he just walked in the front door, hugged my mom and they both sobbed uncontrollably. Then he went into my brother's room and trashed it, while screaming, ""YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!!"" I went in and he looked like a wild animal. He finally sat on the bed and cried, and told me how much they had talked about this. How my brother had promised him he was done with this shit, and he would call if he ever felt like using again. 10 years later this friend is now carrying out a sentence in mental hospital. There were a lot of factors, but I do think losing my brother really broke him too. 

Was my brother trying to use  one last time before he came to church with us and really committed to changing his whole life? Or were we all fooled, and he really was never clean? Had he been clean long enough his tolerance was lower? Was there fent he didn't know about in whatever he shot up? We'll never know. But I do know this, there's no safe way to use heroin. Please, please don't convince yourself you're smarter than the next guy. My brother never stole from anyone, never went to rehab, and never OD'd before. He had been using heroin for about a year before he died. This drug doesn't let you get to rock bottom. 

Thanks for letting me share. I don't think I'll continue the yearly posts, 10 years seems like a good time to end this tradition.

Opiates make me feel normal again ,"I know this is going to come across controversial and I’m in no way saying it’s safe, or a sustainable thing to do, but I have exhausted nearly everything my psychiatrist could try on me at this point. 

I’ve suffered with severe treatment resistant major depressive disorder, anhedonia, social anxiety and C-PTSD / ADHD for a while now which has just gotten worse with age, and with the loss of my father 6 years ago sent me over the edge. 

I have so far tried 16+ different prescription medications, TMS, Ketamine, Therapy, reward reprocessing, TDCS, exercise, diet and many lifestyle / environmental changes. Nothing has worked. 

I have lived in a permanent state of “never feeling rewarded for what I do” for as long as I can remember, apathetic and nihilistic. I could sit in bed all day, but be bored at the same time, and extremely depressed and overthink, take something to slow my thinking down; it ends up making my thoughts so down, but I’m even MORE depressed from being zombified, it’s an utter nightmare. when I am busy, I’m completely apathetic and anhedonic, the reward isn’t there, and my social anxiety makes it near impossible to function. Stepping out my door I’m in a sweat, no medication has helped this, or if it does, it causes such awful worsening of my Anhedonia that there’s 0 benefit. 

Opiates unfortunately are the ONLY substance, both illicit and prescribed, that has consistently brought me relief. - Kratom, oxycodone and the big one, Poppy seed tea. 

I was sober from using poppy seed tea for 6 months daily, eventually having to go in subs to get off it in three months, and was sober for 16+ months but those 16+ months, nothing changed, I was exactly how I was and it just reminded me why I started it in the first place. 

I’m using again, but with naltrexone, trying my best to keep damage as low as possible, because without it, simply I CANNOT function anymore. I can’t. Therapy, meds, exercise all that blah blah blah, it doesn’t work for me. 

I have spent hours upon hours in 2024 researching every night until 6am neuroscience trying to fix myself, with the help of my psychiatrist, he is puzzled as I am. 

I just want to vent as I’m feeling quite alone on this. Has anybody else found that with similar mental health difficulties, even though you’ve genuinely tried extremely hard to find a way without opiates, you don’t find relief and eventually steer back towards them? I don’t want to take an amount to get high, feeling my normal, childhood like self how I used to when I was young is euphoric in itself. I’m exhausted. 

Edit: I am on amphetamine adhd stimulants which help “get me up”, but the “reward” for doing simple tasks, even eating; isn’t there; along with the chronic, persistent social anxiety make thing impossible. Again, I’ve tried all kinds of therapy for my CPTSD to no avail. I started to feel this pre ANY substance use.

Looking for advice,"So I’ve been on and off painkillers for about 5ish months. I have loose hardware in my legs and am awaiting to see an orthopaedic doctor to talk about getting surgery to have them removed from my legs. But in the mean time the pain is unbearable to walk quite often, at first they prescribed me cyclobenzaprine and naproxen, didn’t do anything for me. Went to the emergency room because of pain a second time and they prescribed me tramacet, (tramadol& acetaminophen), and then a few weeks later I went back to the clinic to talk to the doctor about pain medications, he asked me what worked and I said the tramacet kinda did a bit. Before I could finish my sentence he had written me a prescription for tramadol. Was on tramadol for about a month, decided to stop taking them because I was in the same amount of pain regardless of whether I took them or not. Recently the doctor prescribed me 1mg hydromorphone pills, which haven’t really done anything except make my weed a lot stronger lmao. But I was just making this post to ask for recommendations for pain killers and to ask if it’s worth it to go to a pain management clinic. Apologies about how long this post ended up being.

Bad experience with buprenorphine ,"Last night I got an RP b8 buprenorphine hydrochloride and broke off maybe a little more than 1/3 of it almost 1/2 to break up and snort. I know it’s not a very common drug to use like this but i was desperate and knew it was real. I crushed all the powder and snorted it while playing a game on my playstation (kinda off topic but it’s called Detroit: Become Human it’s so good and interesting check it out if you haven’t) but then I started to get really really nauseous and the bright lights from my monitor were really making me super uncomfortable. I walked over to my bed and layed down hoping to just sleep it off but thats when the worst of it started. From that point on I was sitting infront of my trash can violently puking every 30 minutes or so and didn’t end up falling asleep until many hours later. Fast forward to the next day (today), I wake up and instantly throw up. Super nauseous all day, puking every once in a while and can’t eat. It has not been fun.

How does methadone fit in?,"So my local drug service has started me on low dose methadone at 30mg but upping me to 40mg next week. The adjustment to methadone from h wasn’t fun at all and I found myself still wanting to score but social pressure more from my family was the only thing preventing it. I guess I’m kinda stable at the moment but a lot of the day I find myself wanting to score. 

I was addicted to crack for about 5 years and opiates were more of a background thing but once I stopped smoking crack I replaced it with h and oxycodone. Before long I was combining crack and h in the same pipe but ultimately became unsustainable financially. 

How does methadone work for other people? Is it for easing financial stress? Easing cravings? Kicking the withdrawal further down the road? 

I guess I’m seeking advice as to whether methadone is good in the long run. It’s been kinda settling to be level for a change which is a bonus. Is this its purpose?

Got recommended DXM for chronic pain?,"Hey, I'm sorry for posting this but the information on the matter is so scattered i don't know what to make of it. So i have many issues i won't bore you with but aside from the herniated discs and Fibroymalgia, my Myofascial Pain Syndrome is by far the most frustrating. I can't live a normal life. 

Anyway. Been 15+ years of Pregabalin and Oxycodone but I barely exist at this point. A friend realized my depression due to the pain taking my energy and he recommended looking into DXM. What I've gathered though mixed seems to be:

- Serotonin Syndrome - definitely possible when combined with many SSRI and antidepressants. 

- Pain Relief - this seems to be a given? Even where people disagree, it seems it is simply a dosage issue. 

- Depression Relief- trying to do this without Google so I forget the name, forgive me. It is combined with something and given for depression. As an actual Rx.

- Opiate Potentiation - this is what is mixed and thus my question. 


So I need more pain relief than I receive but my doctor is by the book. The US has a ridiculous 90MME equivalent (mg of Morphine) so 60MG of Oxycodone. 


How do I safely incorporate this into my pain relief regimen? Should I take them at the same time? And as a general question, what MG would make sense for my specific situation? The antidepressants being prescribed i believe were 45mg but I am looking for pain relief.

was i oding on 40mg oxy ?,"so recently i started getting into oxy. i know, i know not the best decision. i started off by trying two rp 10s which i didnt feel. i thought maybe i just have a naturally higher tolerance to opioids, even mixed in a little kratom to try and boost any effects. about two weeks later, (last night) i received an order, i got some mundiphara oc 80s. i wasn’t planning on taking damn 40mg of if but i split it in half, than split it again so i had 4 20mg peices. i took 20mg orally, and waited about 30/45 minutes. i didn’t feel any very noticeable effects so i decided to crush up the other 20mg half and snort untill i felt desired effect. long story short i snorted the whole other 20mg so i was a total of 40mg deep. i’m not quite sure how to explain the feeling, i felt a little euphoric and very droswy. i was so tired i could barely keep my eyes open. eventually i got really nauseous and it was a little harder to breath, ended up chugging water and throwing it all up which made me feel a bit better but my breath still felt very shallow which made my anxiety turn up a bit. i tried to stay up as long as i possibly could because i was paranoid and didn’t wanna have to have someone take me to the er, i read oxy ods arnt necessarily fast and sometimes take 1-3 hours so i was getting a bit paranoid. i eventually fell asleep and woke back up. i honestly dont think this was an overdose, definitely a bit too much, but i wanna hear some other peoples opinions. should i just completely stop even trying with oxy? or should i just find a better dose ?",1,13,2025-01-04 21:28:29,oding 40mg oxy recently started getting oxy know know best decision started trying two rp 10s didnt feel thought maybe naturally higher tolerance opioids even mixed little kratom try boost effects two weeks later last night received order got mundiphara oc 80s ’ planning taking damn 40mg split half split 4 20mg peices took 20mg orally waited 30/45 minutes ’ feel noticeable effects decided crush 20mg half snort untill felt desired effect long story short snorted whole 20mg total 40mg deep ’ quite sure explain feeling felt little euphoric droswy tired could barely keep eyes open eventually got really nauseous little harder breath ended chugging water throwing made feel bit better breath still felt shallow made anxiety turn bit tried stay long possibly could paranoid ’ wan na someone take er read oxy ods arnt necessarily fast sometimes take 1-3 hours getting bit paranoid eventually fell asleep woke back honestly dont think overdose definitely bit much wan na hear peoples opinions completely stop even trying oxy find better dose

Do you think addicts are a cursed people?,"Not literally cursed, as if some ancient Egyptian God is continually spiting addicts throughout the millennia, but metaphorically so.

Whenever I think about my own life and the feelings and circumstances that brought me to opioid addiction, I can’t help but feel like it’s so objectively tragic.

I can only speak for myself, but I have to imagine many of you will relate to these feelings. 

Personally, I used opioids as a way to escape myself. I hated who I was, what I felt, and what I thought about *so deeply* that it caused me to seek out the one class of drugs that everyone and their mother says will kill you. I would rather risk death and destitution, on every hour of every day, rather than learn to live with myself. 

I despised what it felt like to live in my own skin. I hated waking up every day and having to deal with myself. I was in so much pain that I resorted to taking a drug that I knew would kill me and ruin my life eventually, and I simply didn’t care. 

And this is what brings me back to the subject of addicts being “cursed.”

Not to throw a pity party for myself or addicts writ large, but to me, this behavior reads like the saddest form of self destruction humans can exhibit. 

It’s a deep, penetrating self-hatred that we try and fail to salve with the most destructive form of self-medication - leading us to hate ourselves even more once the drugs compound all the issues that drove us to addiction in the first place. And finally, watching helplessly as the drugs slowly turn us into unrecognizable shadows of our former selves. 

There are an endless amount of horrific afflictions that people can get slapped with, but if you ask me, addiction is one of the most tragic and insidious of them all.

I would do anything to be able to live with and love myself without the drugs, but I simply don’t believe it’s possible. I’m so tired of myself.

I don't want to do that I don't want to be an addict but it gets so bad I can't stand without the pills and I want macaroni and cheese so I take the pills so I can make macaroni and , cheese. Diclofenac doesn't work very well does it doesn't work because I'm an addict I couldn't go a month without the opioid I tried but then I injured myself again and had to take a hydrocodone. I didn't even make the Mac and cheese. Maybe I'm in pain so much because I got a tolerance to the opioids so my default is pain. I took two pills on. Hristmas. I mixed drugs too you shouldn't to that. I did caffeine and then opioids.

Dope making me physically sick? Strap in its a read.,"
A couple of months ago my guy who’s been consistent for 8-10 years gave me some crazy fent/xylazine mix that almost took me out( I stopped being careful when the product never really changed)but i thought i was  sick truly ill, i was doing smaller amounts of this stuff (before I tested) and my Bp was low heart pounding from the smallest movement i couldnt get up to get water or move in general which is already limited from my disability .. fast forward a couple months later different source, every batch is different i can get 2g and call back and its different i found out its a bunch of batches mixed and the mixing is done by call for grams so its never the same.

I was fine for a bit honestly i was scared to do any amount that wasn’t a dot even thought im a bull i can eat Dope so i was sick on and off for a bit finally I relinquished and did the right amount for me to get well and was okay then i got new stuff that made my heart pound but didnt make me feel like i was gonna pass out and keel from a popped heart, now i get supposedly the same thing and something else thats new and im well longer then the last ones “ i lasted from 11-5 which is absolutely insane it was every 2-3 hrs on the dot but now i cant function i get progressively worse as the night progresses (ive also been taking alot of gabapentin for my shot nerve’s but originally i wasn’t on much- pain has gotten worse) in also pretty much non mobile i dont have to drive to cop i dont see people my pain has gotten to the point where the little things i did cant be done, my good friend says its atrophy I have not been  mobile for years.

I had multiple operations that were deemed done improperly and was mobile on 400mg OC for years but then the rods broke screw’s fractured and i figure life’s easier if i tranquilize myself and sleep as long as i can and its a plus that i dont have to do as much dope, so maybe it’s that ? but last week i was able to piss without the room spinning my heart pounding and feeling numb. 

I’m wondering if anyone has had problems like this with fent or RCs xylazine etc or is my body just truly giving out . 

Also my boy w the boy whole fam has RSV and are always sick anyway so i been disinfecting myself w isopropyl  but i doubt its that .

Stop IV'ing street dope. ,"I had never had an abscess or sore in my 10+ years of using until they started putting tranq in all the dope. I've now had 3 bad ones, and a few less severe, all in the last few months.

 It causes necrosis and wounds that take weeks to heal. I'm on my second batch of antibiotics for them. 

Depending on how much tranq they put in the bags, you can either end up with a dry mouth and low blood pressure, making it very hard to stay awake, or it can feel like you're dying. The first time I shot it, I immediately had to run to the couch to lay down because I knew something was not right. It was the closest feeling to dying I think I could ever imagine.

Why does no-one sniff Morphine?,"I saw Mr. Robot, and supposedly he was sniffing Morphine in a scene. I know Morphine has very low BOA and is really not worth it unless I can get the MS200s or some pill close to 100mg Morphine if I wanna get high and don’t wanna spend all my oxy before script pick-up day.

Anyway, seeing as how Oral and Nasal BOA is pretty much the same, and boofing and IV (I will never IV, before being prescribed Oxy I had to have someone IV me morphine before I got Oxy from my CBP and I absolutely hated the feeling of needles, but idk if boofing would be a good option either.

Help,So I come home from getting subs at the pharmacy for my boyfriend and find a needle in the bathroom. I confront him about it and he immediately denies anything to do with it.  I told him it’s obviously his and if he’s using again. Only sign I can think of is he more tired than usual. Puked randomly the other night. He’s 7 years clean and now I’m realizing something is going on. He said he hasn’t used but he got the needle as a step closer as he’s Been thinking about using again. He said that part of relapse is emotional first? He fixates on the needle and the thought of doing it? Is this possible or is it plain obvious that he is using again. I don’t know if I’m in denial as well😞 I don’t see any track marks on him besides one dead center on his neck that he swears is nothing. Im starting to question everything. I’ve never been around an active heroin addict before and I don’t want to be blind to it what are obvious signs of use that I should look for? I told him he needs to talk to someone and he agreed.,1,3,2025-01-03 10:14:17,help come home getting subs pharmacy boyfriend find needle bathroom confront immediately denies anything told ’ obviously ’ using sign think tired usual puked randomly night ’ 7 years clean ’ realizing something going said ’ used got needle step closer ’ thinking using said part relapse emotional first fixates needle thought possible plain obvious using ’ know ’ denial well😞 ’ see track marks besides one dead center neck swears nothing im starting question everything ’ never around active heroin addict ’ want blind obvious signs use look told needs talk someone agreed
why are the same strength pills so different in effect? ,"i’ve posted before about the Bristol brand of dihydrocodeine being weaker than other brands, specifically Actavis

I have recently noticed the Bristol pill takes alot longer to dissolve than the Actavis, which dissolves almost immediately in the mouth. 

Could this be the reason, i.e Bristol takes longer to absorb, or is it likely to be negligible once in stomach

i’m really trying to get to the bottom of this! i can’t believe 2 identical drugs both manufactured in the UK under the same regulatory authority could be so different - The Bristol pill certainly works, i would know if it didn’t, i would be in severe withdrawals, but i’m certain they aren’t as strong as others",0,6,2025-01-03 09:31:12,strength pills different effect ’ posted bristol brand dihydrocodeine weaker brands specifically actavis recently noticed bristol pill takes alot longer dissolve actavis dissolves almost immediately mouth could reason i.e bristol takes longer absorb likely negligible stomach ’ really trying get bottom ’ believe 2 identical drugs manufactured uk regulatory authority could different bristol pill certainly works would know ’ would severe withdrawals ’ certain ’ strong others

Question/Rant too I guess ,"So I know this may sound like dumb question and I tried to look back on a few different subs and found nothing. Anyway how long does it take to overdose from heroin or fentanyl. I know method of use matters. Once again my 26 years old step son overdosed. I know it gets worse. My wife is a professional enabler. He has a full finished basement and no job as we pay all the bills and buy all the food. She refuses to give him and ultimatum and chooses to believe every word he says. This time apparently his girlfriend who I guess lives her now came back to find him already overdosed. I believe she brought the drugs.. She is an addict too but now being treated like a hero. They used the 2 narcan doses we had here plus whatever EMS administered. I was at work this time. She didn't tell me my neighbor did. I even asked her what the flashing lights were around the house for as they were on a camera. She moved the outside ones even. Lied right to my face saying she had no idea. Had him and his girlfriend stay on our main floor that night where they proceeded to use. Hell he was all bent over sitting in the recliner at 3am and she just sat him up. I have to side the aluminum foil in my room and now probably my work boots. She has no job and has decided she can not have a debit card as he always talks her into buying him something he will eventually return for money. Its getting to be a bit much for me. Our relationship has been all but destroyed but I've been here 20 years almost I don't want to walk away. I love her she is my life. I am watching this destroy her. Her health has declined a considerable amount the last 5 years due to stress. I tried offering the best in the states help and after care to her first to present to him. She flipped out screaming at me telling me I always hated him. Which is FAR from the truth. I hate who he has become. Stealing from him 9 year old niece, grandparents, or really anyone. My basement is destroyed. His health i can only imagine. 
 I guess this is more than the question it was meant to be. Anyway, if someone has any idea how to approach this to help him I would take that too. At this point I am feeling lost and trapped.

"Got hold of half a litre of methadone, I'm prescribed 95ml a day currently - can I get high on it, and if not - why not?","I was on buprenorphine before and I learned that no matter how much I took I could never get high on it, but methadone as far as I can tell is just a normal strong opiate, if I drink an extra 250ml of this methadone i bought on top of my usual 95ml from the pharmacy tomorrow, i should get high right?

I feel like it should be straightforward, but I ask because I have seen it said that it's impossible to get high on methadone if you're stable on a script, and if that IS the case im interested to know why - it is a full opiate agonist like any other is it not? One would assume that using above your tolerance/dependence level will result in opiate effects.

Also HAPPY NEW YEAR :)

Update: have now drank about 300ml, and I'm 3 hours in so I should be peaking round about now, had an empty stomach. I feel a bit high and slightly hard to keep my eyes open, and it's definitely nice, but it's nothing particularly amazing or euphoric - just having a better day than usual.

Hey so I’m the guy that posted yesterday about if my T194s were real… I took one and have some questions. ,So last night when I got them I took 1 and a half and it didn’t feel much different then a real K8 roxi. It wasn’t any sleepier or anything out of the ordinary. What I have realized is last night I can say it felt a little dragged on and I didn’t fall asleep really last night just felt like my eyes were shut but my mind was on? Woke up feeling very unrested. So today I took a 10 mg (btw im trying to taper off the oxys my normal dose is 25-30 mg) so I took the 10 mg and I felt better but now again I feel like I can’t fall asleep. Like I can shut my eyes but I can’t turn my mind off and I feel crazy in my head. Is this a sign that the T189s are fake? Or is it withdrawls? Or what’s yalls opinion? I would think if the T189s are fake they would make me sleepy or have me high instead of just better. Also could it be the fact I was taking K8s for awhile and now I don’t and am taking T189s?

Withdrawal symptoms after one day of use - past history of kratom,"So I’ve never used dihydrocodeine before. Last night I took around 400ng staggered into two doses.

I felt incredible bliss and euphoria. Just general contentment and peace. All the normal stuff you’d expect from an opiate.

Mentally i felt anxious.

Is this possible to have a sort of rebound effect so quickly after th drug wears off?

I have loads more of the stuff but as much as I loved it, I’m not touching it again for a while given how horrible I felt this morning.

The only other thing I’d note is that I used to be addicted to Kratom a year ago. I quite cold. Turkey from 20gpd. I had the same bone aches for 3 days.

Opioid side effect (eye pressure/pain) advice?,"To be clear I am not seeking medical advice.

I am in pain management.

So I have tried several medications (lyrica + tramadol, lyrica + vicodin, lyrica + oxycodone)for chronic pain and I am having the same side effect with different opioids for some reason. I wasn't sure if other people do and my doctors have been trying different opioids to try to figure out why it is causing it...

They know its specifically not the lyrica because I don't have the side effect when on lyrica alone. I do have side effect if I take opioid alone and with lyrica. But I need to take the lyrica with opioid to properly manage the pain.

So I get what feels like increase pressure behind my left eye and intense pain what feels like behind my left eye/temple region in head. Which sucks because I am perscribed the opioids for chronic pain while recovery from complete ""frayed"" bicep that has to be reattached and bone/muscle removal from my shoulder/rotator cuff.

I should add I have been to ophthalmologist and optometrist who checked my eye pressure and said it's normal despite me ""feeling"" pressure type pain.

So on one hand trying to use the opioids to manage the pain while I heal from multiple surgeries, but it's also causing a very specific pain (what feels like pressure) pain in left temple and eye region.

So was just asking if this was something to be expected (my doctors say this is odd reaction) so I'm reaching out and seeing what I can possibly maybe do to help alleviate this pressure pain, while still taking opioids until I heal completely so I don't have to manage pain anymore.

Maybe it’s just my mind trying to play some tricks on me because I feel so alone in this fight, I want to be done with that life but I’m not sure that the junkie inside me feels the same way… 

Not really sure why I’m posting this, just needed to get it off my chest.

I typically smoke a gram a day of “raw” that is offered from my people. Will these be of any help? 

I have some leftover foils as well, would combining them displace the hydro from my receptors? 

Edit:

Sorry, by raw what I meant what there are two choices of product. 

The one that is cut and repressed that costs much less or the product uncut. He saves me a good amount before cutting because I prefer it and I will sometimes cut it myself to my own liking. 

It is much stronger than the basic stuff, no clue of the true Fent dosage per gram of powder but it’s about 10x as much as the cut product.

I took them, initially felt a slight rush of euphoria and boost in mastication but it faded quickly and only provided about a 5/10 in relief. Still enough to shower, shave, and get out the house and hustle.

Frightened and frustrated - mental health & poppy seed tea ,"I’ve done this to myself, however at absolutely not as “just to get high”, I’ve been living with extremely frustrating, vile major depressive disorder and social anxiety that just REFUSES to respond to traditional treatments. 16+ prescription medications, TMS, Ketamine therapy, talk therapy, reward reprocessing therapy, exercise, diet, environmental changes, everything has FAILED. The anhedonia is so disgusting and soul destroying I have gone through hell with poppy seed withdrawals in the past, and vowed to never use them again, but after 16+ months sober and not even consuming alcohol, after I took PST daily in 2023 for nearly 5 months, I have binged on it again for the past 5 days so I can enjoy Christmas and new years, out of pure frustration of nothing working for my mental health. 

Now I’m terrified of severe withdrawal. I’ve woken up fine, no worsening of my mental health but I know the half life of this is ridiculously long, and tonight before I dosed I started to experience extreme dizziness, vertigo and profuse sweating. 

I’m taking naltrexone nightly as well, ultra low dose at 200mcg, and an NMDA antagonist. 

How likely am I to experience horrendous withdrawal in the next couple of days? Literally my baseline is hellish enough, having to go through horrendous withdrawal on top of my idiotic brain refusing to cooperate under no substance just seems like a death sentence, I remeber how bad it was in 2023, but nothing has helped me, not even other illicit substances.

My SR-17018 story 🚥 (not the usual )✅,"what it would help with that.

I’ve been addicted too opiates for 3 years now mainly oxymorphone ,morphine and diladud.

I have tried everything too get off these opioids such as

1.benzos
2.suboxone
3.cold turkey 
Nothing works  
Until I found SR-17018 it’s not a perfect substance like people on here make it out too be but it takes away 75 percent of withdrawal and decreases your tolerance at the same time

Dosing every 7-12 hours 
Low tolerance 25-50mg
Fent zone tolerance 100-150mg 

Effects 
No euphoria or high per se your almost sober but takes away dope sickness maybe a little sedation . But rapidly decreases opioid tolerance 


Day 1
Wake up 6:30am in agony cold sweats and intense pain but still have too go too work  so I dose the SR-17018 at 30mg . 2 hours later I can actully enjoy myself a little bit for the first time in years 0 euphoria tho . 
5:00pm I get off take half a Xanax bar and start railing lines of ketamine I truly felt like I was normal again 

Day 2 I have too work again wake up at 7:00am 
Every morning I wake up I’m in  intense pain due too not dosing so it takes me a while too get going at 2:00pm I slipped up and took some diladud so I have too restart the next day 

Day 3 (restart)

Wake up at 7 dose some SR-17018 then head to work . All my coworkers say I seem like a different person even my family . I can actully socialize properly and I’m not dying on the inside

Preventing Necrosis from Xylazine,"To first try to figure out how to reduce necrosis caused by Xylazine we have to look at Xylazine's Pharmacological Effects:

* **Alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonist**: Xylazine works by stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which decreases sympathetic nervous system activity. This results in:
   * **Vasoconstriction** (narrowing of blood vessels): Reduced blood flow can deprive tissues of oxygen and nutrients, leading to ischemia and tissue damage.
* **Sedation and Reduced Mobility**: Prolonged immobility from xylazine’s sedative effects can impair blood circulation in the extremities, exacerbating poor tissue oxygenation.

Just throwing this out there because I thought it was interesting. While I was still using I was trying various different methods to prevent necrosis while injecting fetty with Xylazine. What I found to work best was actually Viagra (no this is not a joke), here's why...

In theory, Viagra (sildenafil) could have some potential to help mitigate tissue damage like necrosis, especially in its early stages, due to its mechanism of action. Viagra is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor that enhances nitric oxide signaling, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and increased blood flow. This improved blood circulation could theoretically help deliver more oxygen and nutrients to damaged tissues, which are critical for wound healing and preventing further tissue death.

But with that said we have to look at Sildenafil (Viagra)'s mechanism vs practicality:

* While Viagra improves blood flow, necrosis caused by xylazine or other factors often involves complex mechanisms, including severe localized inflammation, infection, and direct tissue damage.
* Improved circulation alone might not be enough to counteract these factors fully.

There's also risks from side effects:

* Viagra can lower blood pressure, which might be risky for individuals with unstable cardiovascular health or those using other medications or substances that affect blood pressure. But most notably,  Xylazine is an analog of Clonidine, which means that Xylazine already lowers your blood pressure significantly.

There are also some other honorable mentions that I considered but have not tried:

**L-arginine**, an amino acid that boosts nitric oxide production, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and improved blood circulation. This mechanism is similar to how medications like Viagra function. Some evidence suggests that high doses of L-arginine can enhance blood flow, which may aid in tissue oxygenation and healing. However, side effects can include nausea, cramps, and diarrhea. It's also important to note that L-arginine should not be taken with sildenafil (Viagra).

Another supplement to consider is **Ginkgo biloba**, an herbal remedy known to improve blood circulation by promoting vasodilation. This increased blood flow can enhance oxygen delivery to tissues, potentially supporting wound healing. However, Ginkgo biloba may cause side effects such as headaches, dizziness, and gastrointestinal upset. Additionally, it can interfere with blood clotting, so it should be used cautiously, especially in individuals taking blood thinners or those with bleeding disorders.

Some other considerations...

# Topical Ointments and Dressings

*""Topical antibiotics are commonly used in combination with petrolatum-based ointments to decrease bacterial burden of xylazine-associated wounds and promote autolytic debridement.""*

*""1% silver sulfadiazine (e.g., Silvadene™) has been a preferred topical therapy in caring for individuals with xylazine-associated wounds. Silver sulfadiazine is a prescription topical antibiotic that is often used in the treatment of burn wounds in outpatient and inpatient settings. It has broad spectrum antimicrobial effects and a low chance of generating antibiotic resistance. 42,43 The antimicrobial effect of silver sulfadiazine stays active for over 72 hours after application, which provides ongoing treatment for patients who have less access to dressing changes.43 In addition, silver sulfadiazine maintains moisture that can promote autolytic debridement and reduce tissue trauma during dressing changes.""*

# a. Antibacterial Ointments

* **Silver sulfadiazine**: A topical antibiotic commonly used for burns, it can reduce bacterial load and promote wound healing by keeping the wound moist.
* **Mupirocin or Bacitracin**: Broad-spectrum antibacterial ointments to prevent or treat bacterial infections.

# b. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) Gels

* Gels containing agents that promote oxygen delivery to tissues might theoretically reduce ischemia-related damage and support wound healing.

# c. Growth Factor-Enhanced Ointments

Help!! Saline solution mixed with H for easy use relief sinus dryness. ,"As the title suggests, I’ve been dissolving my substance (diacetylmorphine) in distilled water for a while and using it intranasally. However, I’ve started noticing significant dryness and irritation.

Today, I decided to try mixing it with a saline solution I bought on Amazon. The bottle labeled it as a “nasal moisturizer,” claiming it was safe for daily use. I assumed it would be harmless.

However, when I mixed a significant amount of the substance with the saline solution, I noticed a distinct smell. Upon checking the ingredient list, I realized it contained more than just distilled water and sodium chloride (saline). It also included disodium phosphate, phenylcarbinol, monosodium phosphate, and benzalkonium chloride. As I stirred the mixture, I noticed precipitates forming and gas being released, which suggests a chemical reaction has occurred.

This raises my main concerns:

	1.	Has the diacetylmorphine undergone a chemical transformation due to these ingredients?
	2.	Is the solution still safe for use?
	3.	Have I effectively wasted a gram of the substance?

From what I’ve researched, the ideal solution for this purpose seems to be pure distilled water or saline made from sodium chloride pellets. I plan to switch to that moving forward. However, in the meantime, can I safely use this mixture? Any knowledgeable insights would be greatly appreciated.

Nonsexual full-body orgasm from snorting coke and h. ,"
Last night, I was snorting some coke and clean #4 after consuming two glasses of wine, and I had the weirdest body sensation I've ever felt from a drug. As the h started to kick in, the warm fuzzy feeling slowly turned into what I can only describe as an orgasm. It was pretty peculiar because I wasn't horny at all, and actually, I have absolutely no sex drive on h. Despite my Johnson being soft, I felt like I could cum from this sensation that rippled throughout my whole body for at least ten minutes. I've never experienced anything like that in my life, and the best way I can describe it is a “non-sexual full-body orgasm.” I apologize if this is smut; I felt like I needed to share this experience with you guys because I really wanted to see if anyone else gets sensations like this. I was just appalled because it wasn't sexual at all 😂😂",6,5,2024-12-30 16:19:27,nonsexual full-body orgasm snorting coke h. last night snorting coke clean 4 consuming two glasses wine weirdest body sensation 've ever felt drug h started kick warm fuzzy feeling slowly turned describe orgasm pretty peculiar n't horny actually absolutely sex drive h. despite johnson soft felt like could cum sensation rippled throughout whole body least ten minutes 've never experienced anything like life best way describe “ non-sexual full-body orgasm. ” apologize smut felt like needed share experience guys really wanted see anyone else gets sensations like appalled n't sexual 😂😂

suboxone making me feel weird - depression and my treatment.,"back story - located in canada, at 14 I was prescribed trammadol and then percocet for 3 herniated discs, I was abruptly taken aff of them after a year, I then started getting hydros off of a family member, I had a conversation with the doc that was prescribing pain meds and he turned me to a methadone clinic. have been on methadone for 10 years, around year 6 I started gaining weight and having mood changes, ive always struggled with depression but nothing like this. I have a great job making 250k/yr, just bought a house things were going well, still depressed and my work was slipping but I was ok. 

I started using hydros while on methadone (90mg hydromorphone contin IV DAILY), tired of going up in dose instead of down, I wasn't sleeping at night due to the pain, and again affecting my work. I had an amazing trip i was supposed to take for work that was a huge opportunity for my career, and couldn't because of methadone. at this point I snapped and had enough, I went into my doctors office and demanded to he put on sublocade due to the good things I've heard, he started me microdosing suboxone, withdrawals were unbearable for weeks, I started using again to help with the withdrawls, after getting to 18mg suboxone a day he stopped the methadone, still experiencing some withdrawal symptoms. the suboxone doesnt help at all with the pain, my MAT doctor sent me to another doctor who prescribed hydromorphone contin 2x daily which I'm taking orally - still in pain. besides all that I'm more depressed than I've ever been can't get up and do anything, no energy, I feel like I'm in a dream state all the time, what other treatment options exist for people like me, I feel like pain management ive got a life sentence on MAT.. 

If anyone has a similar story to me, and has found something that worked I would love to hear your story.

"Bag empty, what to do now?? ","I Had a small baggie of H (maybe about 0.75 g as I got shorted bad....)....spread it out over about a week but before that was taking about 1-4mg of Suboxone (not subutext) a day (would say about a third of  the time I snorted it the others sublingual....was taking 2-4 mg/day SL for most part then started lowering and skipping days to try to get off then trying manipulate so I could actually feel *something* but it left me wanting more....)

I can try to order something, but it wouldn't be here today and don't got connects really where I live. I could buy some kratom or 7-oh at the head shop, but funds are low for sure (cheaper than buying another bag though IF I can even find...less riskier though for sure and faster).

AlI have is Suboxone (8 mg pills and a 12 mg strip broken into about 2 mg squares but they are also dry). I also have 300 mg gabapentin that I took 2 of this morning (usually take 1 a day but lately been 2-6, prob 2-3 average) as well as flexeril and baclofen (don't think you are suppose to combine the 3 of those? I got the gabs originally though to stop the baclofen cus messed my GABA receptors up with it coming out of a lyrica binge months ago, but was originally given it for pain 
Since the flexeril makes me tired....unfortunately I will take more than I should and even 2 days taking 20-30mg I have to have something to fall back on otherwise my usually emotionally unstable self gets more volatile and downright scary). Also have 50 mg of hydrozyzine/vistaril, but that me tired and then groggy the next day (maybe I could split it up with my scale?). Celebrix/celocobix I take daily for pain already (it's like a strong ibuprofen but works better for my arthritis as it's selective). I have 650 mg extended release Tylenol (labeled for arthritis pain), immodium, pepto, 1mg clonazapam, the shitty manufacturer (not Pressies, I get them from my dr but im stuck with 1 specific pharmacy cus the chain doesn't like how my Dr writes scripts and flagged me...I am pretty low right now though and appointment is pushed out from holidays so have to use sparingly.) I take adderal for adhd also and need a minimum of 30 mg just to get up in the morning. I have a whole freaking big bag of pharms so could have something else that would help, who knows.

I Used the last little bit of the H last night/early morning (like a point or less) well tried to, but didn't feel anything (didn't want to snort cus little left, tried to iv but my veins suck and don't have much experience there, and didn't have stuff to attempt to boof with). Last time I took Suboxone was 23rd or 24th I think and took enough h for a light buzz Saturday night/early Sunday morning (also had been mixing with some coke every day). 

Starting to feel off now with loose stool, more tired than usual, sniffles, body temp changes it feels (also a bit worried about any possible infection from the 3-4 times I tried to stick myself....only had an old but unused insulin needle stashed away and while I tried to wash my arms and heat the needle to sterilize it, it felt pretty blunt and would bend easily...I dug around a bit though also trying find a vein but could never get return...yes, I'm stupid I know...I tried to shoot only once a few years ago but missed and had a lump for awhile cus injected part of it so was t going try to inject period without knowing for sure....).

I know if I take the sub and some got in my system last night or is still there from before, I risk PW. If life permitted, I wouldn't even mind going back to rehab or detox but I can't really if I want an income right now, which I really need....also could really use some sort of help mentally and rehab was the only place that helped (psych hospitals make me worse). I keep going in circles also cus like I want off the sub but worry I'll just get hooked again either cus I'm in pain or cus I relapse on something).

Honest opinion: how good is heroin iv really?,"Just because it’s good it doesn’t mean I should try it, that’s not my intention with this question. But I want to hear y’all honest opinions. I’ve tried some opioids but never found them too good. I had only one time with oxy where some sort of nodding with tingling euphoria began, but it just teased me, sadly didn’t get any stronger and left soon. All the other times I got a nice warmth feeling in my body but nothing too serious- far far away from the feeling of an orgasm. Nothing compared to 4mmc. 
The only time I thought the next morning fuck this was nice I’d like to try that another time was this one oxy experience. I thought if this is what everyone is talking about, I understand them. Waited some time and did a larger dose, but nothing. Just the warmth feeling. I even snorted H but this also didn’t give me anything more than the warmth. Tried to chase the dragon but fucked up, my friend got it right and said he had a rush that felt really good. 

But what do y’all say, is it really an orgasmic euphoria or just this feeling of warmth? And what was this one oxy experience where I had the feeling if I took more I’d get an actual body feeling of cumming?

Beta Endorphins & Spinal Injuries: Could Opioids Replace a “Broken” Natural System?,"I’ve come to believe that, for some of us with spinal injuries or CSF dysfunction, opioids might function much like insulin does for diabetics—filling a true physiological need rather than simply covering up pain. Here’s the reasoning:

Endorphin Deficiency: Our bodies produce beta endorphins (natural opioids) to keep pain, stress, and mood in balance. But spinal trauma and chronic inflammation can break that system, leaving us deficient and struggling with far more than pain—fatigue, depression, and a feeling that our bodies just aren’t “right.”

Replacing What’s Missing: Just as a diabetic needs insulin to regulate blood sugar, we may need opioids to replace our missing endorphins and restore normal function. This isn’t about “chasing a high”—it’s about achieving maintenance levels so we can live a decent life.

Mislabeling Patients: Many people who’ve been called “opioid addicts” or “drug seekers” could actually be suffering from an endorphin deficiency due to spinal or CSF issues. Likewise, some who are labeled “depressed” may just need proper homeostatic support from something that acts like the body’s own opioid system.

Why It Matters: If we start viewing certain opioid therapies as legitimate maintenance treatments for those with documented endorphin deficits, it could reshape prescribing practices and reduce stigma. We need focused research—measuring endorphin levels, tracking CSF changes—to confirm this theory and help people get the care they truly need.


This perspective could transform the debate around opioids for spinal injuries. By recognizing a genuine physiological shortfall, we might finally treat patients with dignity and precision—rather than assuming their motive is addiction when it might just be survival. Let’s push for more studies and a more compassionate approach to prescribing. We all deserve relief—and respect.

Can anyone relate to this?,"Well,im a 24 yr old male and its been almost 5 years that im on and off opioids/opiates,started with heroin(never was a heavy or iv user) at 20 yrs old and ended with Oxycodone now.
The fact is that im at this point:everyone around me judge me as a bad or lazy  person,and i never judged any of my friends or family members for their addiction or problems.
When i was 5 yrs old i was abused,i was bullied my whole life for my body,and i never finded real love in this life.
I always tried to act ""normal"" and i always tried to make my life better whitout using opioids,but that never worked sadly.
Since i was a kid i struggled with depression,and its getting worse.
Right now i take just 25mg of Oxycodone everyday,i dont feel very bad(at least i dont want to end my life),but i dont feel good for sure.
At this point,what am i supposed to do?
I can up my dose of just 5mg,so it wold be 30mg everyday and it could be slightly better,but there is a part of me that just want to completly nodd and like sleep for ever,cause my brain keeps bringing back all the childhood trauma and other bad stuff.
I also think that 30mg everyday is not enough,if i could choose,i would take 40mg two times everyday,just to dont think about how sad this life is,and it was sad too when i was sober,even worse.
I dont see happiness in opioids,i just see an escape.
Thats all,thank to everyone who is reading this.

I’ve come to a crossroads once again ,"I’ve been dependent on dilaudid a few times over the last few years. Detoxing and going through withdrawals only when I ran out of places to buy more from and everything ran dry. 

I got on suboxone for a little bit, then thought I could manage chipping away. Taking dilaudid for two or three days of the week, then waiting a day and taking subs for the rest of the week. Then the dills dried up again and I tried cold coping, was sold fentanyl. Said fuck it and went on a week long bender with that poison. Ran out, and naively took a sub the following morning. Got thrown into precipitated withdrawals. Went through that, got back on subs, then finally made the decision to get on sublocade.

 It seemed like my life was turned around, I felt cured on sublocade. I started saving money, started planning a trip. Got a third injection and flew to Vietnam. Travelled around south east Asia for the better part of a year. 

Eventually I had to come back. That was in September. As soon as I got back I got another sublocade injection. Then as soon as winter started to rear its ugly head, and I was due for another injection, I denied it…. I figured I could manage without it… but in reality I was just planning my relapse.

Now here I am, three months later, and I’ve been using 2-3 times a week on average. The last week I used 5 out of 7 days, and today I’m finally feeling what I can describe as full blown cravings paired with mild withdrawals for the first time in a year. The monkey is on my back, knock knock knocking once again.

I know that I’m at a crossroads. If I hang in there and perceiver, I’ll just have a day or two of feeling shitty, then just have to deal with the cravings. Or, if pick up more dilaudid and I use again, I’ll more than likely be back in full blown dependency before the year is out. 

I’m not really sure what the point of this post is. Just venting I guess. I hope I have the strength not to go down this road again ",3,1,2024-12-29 19:18:53,’ come crossroads ’ dependent dilaudid times last years detoxing going withdrawals ran places buy everything ran dry got suboxone little bit thought could manage chipping away taking dilaudid two three days week waiting day taking subs rest week dills dried tried cold coping sold fentanyl said fuck went week long bender poison ran naively took sub following morning got thrown precipitated withdrawals went got back subs finally made decision get sublocade seemed like life turned around felt cured sublocade started saving money started planning trip got third injection flew vietnam travelled around south east asia better part year eventually come back september soon got back got another sublocade injection soon winter started rear ugly head due another injection denied it… figured could manage without it… reality planning relapse three months later ’ using 2-3 times week average last week used 5 7 days today ’ finally feeling describe full blown cravings paired mild withdrawals first time year monkey back knock knock knocking know ’ crossroads hang perceiver ’ day two feeling shitty deal cravings pick dilaudid use ’ likely back full blown dependency year ’ really sure point post venting guess hope strength go road

Pre-cip WDS,"Okay so I have been on subs for almost 2 months now ( which by the way was a nightmare to accomplish but here I am ) so anyways my Dr. Had a brilliant idea to tell his patients they no longer can prescribe (most people) alprazolam anymore.. me being one of those people. So now I dont feel normal without them. So I took my little 22 minute trip to philly yesterday and grabbed some. Buuuuut I was tempted and got  D AKA fet and tranq. I purposely didnt take a sub that day and I had only gotten 5 bags... I did 2, 2 days ago and than I did the last 3 yesterday. So I'm on day 3 without taking any subs. I did my last bag at 3AM this morning so it's only going on about 5 hours. My question is if I only did 5 and accidently spread them out in 2 days.. when will it be safe to take my subs again without sending myself into pre-cip. Google says 72 hours with fet and I'm assuming that's with like a full blown habit. I know the WDs are gonna be nothing when they come on compared to what it's like coming off with a habit (my worst nightmare) but I'm still so mad at myself that I'm gonna have to wait til I feel shitty. But I just don't wanna send myself into pre-cip and than really be up shits creek. Someone told me since I have subs built up in my system I can take it as normal but I don't trust that for one second. Idk I've never been ""clean"" in 16 years up until now (clean with MAT) so I really dunno how this works... especially since it's not H anymore it's the tranq and fet cause I know with that the rule is 24 hours but back in 2012 I waited like 39 hours and I still got sent into precipitated WDS. and than other times I'd wait 24 hours and take a small piece and still get thrown into it.

"5 days clean, on bupe, struggling","Hi guys. If anyone can please help me understand the causation of PWD in this situation, i will really really be grateful. 

For context, I have sniffed H (came back as fent and morphine actually, so that’s what i got) for over 5 years. this past Sunday, i waited almost 20 hrs since last use and took the first subutex/pure bupe, and still went into horrible horrible PWD. had to spend the night in the ER, miss christmas, the works. 

I have felt like absolute trash ever since Sunday. it’s VERY slowly gotten better mostly bc the PWD ended after like 24 brutal hours, and i’ve been slowly regaining the color in my face, my ability to speak coherently, open my eyes, but i’m still struggling to stand/walk like at ALL, i have not eaten in 5+ days, barely sleeping, can barely function and have to go back to work in a matter of days. i have no clue how i’m gonna pull this off.

I’m currently on 8mg bupe 3x/day so 24mg/day. have been regularly dosing at least that (tuesday was a couple extra bc so sick) since Monday night. did not go into PWD again when i started again Monday, thank god, but it had been well over 24hrs since use. so today is day 5 of regular bupe.

My cravings are horrible. I am feening like an animal. I have almost a full bun left (7 bags) and a couple blue 30s, maybe a couple tramadol 50s too. I cannot bring myself to flush them. Is there any method i could take any of these things without risking PWD? or is it just another shot in the dark? when i was using, i was sniffing minimum a bun a day. sometimes two. could usually nod off about half a bun, 4-6 bags. 

i don’t know if my tolerance has really changed over 5 days. i’m trying so hard to keep from using at all. but i at least want to know any helpful information as far as preventing PWD. i cannot do that again. not for at least, a very long time.

Please any tips, insight or experience will be very valuable to me. I don’t have many people i can talk to about this. and this is my first real (greater than one day) attempt at MAT. and i absolutely hate it. 

Edit: A few other questions I have, 

1. if anyone knows any way to make the mf enormous sublingual tablet any less disgusting to dissolve, please share. I’ve been trying to get the films but have not been able to through my pharmacy, at least not without switching to suboxone which i’m nervous could be another PWD situation, whether just from the switch from subutex or using.

need some help tapering DHC,"hi, hope you’re doing good. 
recently I had a relapse after I had been one and a half months without opiates. I started using occasionally about a year ago although I always seem to binge for 2-8 days sometimes. 

the opiate I started using was DHC and I used seven days ago two times, wasn’t so bad, waited and now since 24 dec I haven’t stopped for five days, mostly due to fear of withdrawal though I know this time my doses and have a chance to taper, but i’ve always dropped cold turkey just because my dumbass brain though one couldn’t taper with opiates, and rather that would intensify withdrawal and overall increase side effects. idk why, but that always had been my logic, so here I would like to confirm how I could do my taper (maybe first cut by 50%, and then by 10%-20%)
and if it is actually a good idea, and could help. 

I took dihydrocodeine 

17th: 180mg 
18th: 200mg 

24th: 150mg
25th: 200mg 
26th: 120 mg 
27th: 150mg 
28th: 150mg 

my doses haven’t exceeded 200mg 
how much do tapers help? if done properly. 

 
Could a kind of fast taper, due to the short period of consumption, help? Like tomorrow or when the wds start to kick in I could take 75mg and dic 30 50mg and dic 31 only 20. Or something like that. 

if you have any other tips i would be grateful.

Codeine ceiling dose/effects Question ,"So as we all know codeine has a ceiling dose of between 300-400mg where anything over that can't be metabolised into morphine and won't increase euphoria etc.
My question is this - how long does it take for this ceiling effect to ""reset"" (for lack of a better term)? Is 300-400mg the maximum that can be metabolised in something like a 24hr period, or is it per dose e.g after 6 hours or so once effects from an initial dose are subsiding  another dose can still be effective?
I've looked into it but haven't been able to find any definitive answers.
Obviously everyone's physiology is different so I'd imagine there might not be a concrete answer here.

Also as a side note if it makes any difference I'm lucky to be a ""hyper converter"" of codeine so despite dabbling in more than my fair share of opiates/oids over the years I still get a pretty pleasant buzz from codeine, strangely though the 2 or 3 times I've tried dihydrocodeine I didn't seem to get any real noticeable effect, but that could have been due to tolerance at the time and/or the dose being too low.

If there's a more appropriate sub to ask this on please let me know.
P.S please, if you're just going to chime in and say ""codeine is shit tier opiate, just do oxy"" please just scroll on by, I enjoy codeine, I know it's a very weak opiate, but just because it doesn't do anything for you doesn't mean other people shouldn't be allowed to enjoy.

"6 weeks of opiate binge, zero withdrawal","I used heroin, methadone, oxycodone daily for this past month and a half. 

Up to a gram of H or up to 120mg of oxy or up to 120mg of methadone, never skipping a day.

This was my longest binge ever, and what surprised me it was double than my last binge I had couple years ago, where withdrawal symptoms were very apparent, albeit short (after using 3g of 92% pure H over 22 days), most annoying of which were hyperosmia and RLS.

Since I was expecting withdrawals, I loaded up on immodium, pregabalin, xans and diazepam, as well as a lot of vitamin C, multivitamins and everythint else that I thought would be necessary.

24 hours after my last dose I loaded up on multivitamins and didn't want to use any meds unless absolutely necessary.

The only thing that happened was four days of acute depression (slept 16h a day, most common for me after a binge since opioids barely let me sleep) and very short ejaculation time.

How is this possible? Anyone had similar experience?

Tapentadol,"Due to my lumbar problems, I started taking 200 mg of Tapentadol with a medical prescription (30 pills for 35 €) for pain crises only.

Compared to another medication I took previously, I do experience a high feeling with this one. However, what puzzles me is that I can't seem to sleep. I don't feel overly stimulated, and my heart rate is normal, yet I find myself wide awake.

I spoke with my physician, who mentioned that most people actually find Tapentadol helps them sleep better. In my case, though, it has the opposite effect.

So, I feel like I'm exchanging physical pain for endless nights without rest.

How easy is it to get on to Buvidal? UK,"Never been to a clinic before but I have an appt in January. Currently about 320mg oxy use. Before ibogaine earlier this year it was 600-800mg daily. With H in between to cover stop gaps. 

Anyway, I'm not looking for subs in form of pills or films, I really want the sub injection as I've heard it has a very high success rate, very low side effects, safe, libido returned for many, no withdrawals or very very minor when it comes to the 4 week mark of their last shot and some people do a 1 shot and done. 

I've been told the injection is very expensive and they don't give it to everyone. What can make my chances higher? Are there any private providers or rehabs that offer this treatment? I believe this is my last shot at sobriety because what else can I do. Is there anything I shouldn't say that would rule me out? Shall I tell the worker about the Ibogaine clinic trip?

I'm scared of how good it is.,"I know I'm not the first to think this, but I'm genuinely terrified of the psychological hold opioids have on me. I stayed sober from opioids for a year simply because I couldn’t get my hands on any, yet during that entire year, it never left my mind. The moment I managed to get more, I relapsed.

I have a job, and I limit myself to taking it once a week as a reward. But it would be a lie to say I don’t constantly think about the next dose. Right now, I’m high on ODSMT (and it feels so good, I feel so comfortable, like I’m back in my mother’s womb). My first experience was with Tramadol and Oxycodone, and I believe trying them was the biggest mistake of my life because it opened Pandora’s box.

My question, I know adderall does interact with release endorphins (dopamine).  But I think there are multiple typed of dopamine...?

Will taking adderall prolong my paws. Im not really a fan of stimulants but compared to the hellish paws I've been going through... It's way better.

Overdose experience? ,When i had overdosed . I personally have no memory of this. All is what ive been told.  My boyfriend said that this time i just passed out.  He said i wasn't breathing. He said that my mouth was wide open.  I was stiff.  He was tryijg to give me CPR. He said he couldn't get any oxygen in me. He i wasnt moving. I wasn't breathing. He tried to admistrate the narcan and i wouldnt be moving but as soon as he would try to do it.  I would start freaking out.  I was try to stop him. He believes i have a demon that wants to kill me and is trying to kill me. Because every time he as tried to use narcan. I would try to stop him.  Then i would go back to not breathing. He said i started to have convulsions . He said i was screaming . I have no memory of this . He then gave me a another narcan. He said he would pray over my body . He would hit my chest.  Try breathing into my mouth. But i wasnt breathing. I had my mouth open. I wasnt moving.  He didnt think the second one was enough. I dont know how long it lasted.  The only memory i have had is me trying to cover my nose. But i don't understand why i would try to stop him. I just vaugly remember seeing my hand come up to my nose freaking out and then i dint remember anything else. Hes very traumatized by this.  Ive tried looking up waking up in the middle of an overdose but nothing comes up. I don't understand what happened. Why i would try to stop someone from saving my life?  He would tell me to breathe.  Take deep breaths.  He was begging for me to stay alive.  He was doing anything and everything he could think of. Has anyone had any similar experience.  Does Anyone know whats going on. Is there something wrong with me. And hes told me in the past i have had similar overdoes in the past but i would be fine for a few hours after smoking and like 2 hours later i would overdose. I would lose consciousness. I hate that hes had to go thur this.  I have no emotional connection to my overdoses. I dont have feeling about it. Maybe the only emotion i have is denial. Any answer would help . I feel like none of it makes sense.  ,4,1,2024-12-26 23:21:59,overdose experience overdosed personally memory ive told boyfriend said time passed said n't breathing said mouth wide open stiff tryijg give cpr said could n't get oxygen wasnt moving n't breathing tried admistrate narcan wouldnt moving soon would try would start freaking try stop believes demon wants kill trying kill every time tried use narcan would try stop would go back breathing said started convulsions said screaming memory gave another narcan said would pray body would hit chest try breathing mouth wasnt breathing mouth open wasnt moving didnt think second one enough dont know long lasted memory trying cover nose n't understand would try stop vaugly remember seeing hand come nose freaking dint remember anything else hes traumatized ive tried looking waking middle overdose nothing comes n't understand happened would try stop someone saving life would tell breathe take deep breaths begging stay alive anything everything could think anyone similar experience anyone know whats going something wrong hes told past similar overdoes past would fine hours smoking like 2 hours later would overdose would lose consciousness hate hes go thur emotional connection overdoses dont feeling maybe emotion denial answer would help feel like none makes sense

Any idea why I don’t respond to opiates?,"I’ve never experienced what people say opiates do, and maybe not even what they are supposed to do (both recreationally and for pain management). In the 90s I tried tons of times to get high on hydros and never worked, if I took too many I’d just feel dizzy and nauseous. Shot heroin with a buddy about 20 years ago…he got high AF and. I just puked a bunch, no euphoria whatsoever, and felt like I had the flu that night and the day after.
I’ve had a few minor surgeries in the last few years that came with Percocet in the past. Only one time I remember feeling kinda more interested in life and content (taken only as prescribed). 
I had a more invasive surgery and when I woke up I was screaming in pain as if there wasn’t any IV pain management happening at all. The next time I had a similar surgery I mentioned this and got a nerve block first (that maybe didn’t work) and the same torturous 10+/10 happened. They had to give me so much IV (morphine I’m guessing?..not sure what the use at the hospitals now) that my blood pressure dropped too low and they had to stop. 
Now, I’m no sissy - I have really high pain tolerance, military etc. I can suck it up. But this was next level horror. Was sent home with hydromorphone, which I took VAST quantities of and even got a refill. Never once felt anything different/pleasant even after the pain was gone. I guess it’s good I can’t get high because of all the fentanyl crap, but now I’m also terrified to ever have surgery again. 
Oh, and I get insomnia and more energy when I take pain pills, which now and then I’ll take up to 15-40mg hydro to get housework done. Never done frequently or enough to develop tolerance and haven’t had to go withdrawals (I know what a huge blessing this is; I wouldn’t wish that on anyone). So clearly they do something, just not sure what or why.

Dilaudid after spine dislocation & severe multiple herniations,"So, I have hEDS. I’m 28, have had both knees replaced by the time I was 21, a full chest wall reconstruction surgery due to my slipped ribs, experience weekly dislocations, along with a lot of other pain and Eds symptoms. About two weeks ago for the first time I dislocated my spine, which caused 3 different herniated discs along with other symptoms (severe sciatica, etc)
I have a very wonderful pain management doctor who prescribed me 2-4mg of dilaudid every 4-6 hours. I’ve needed them very badly as the pain is horrific and unbearable, and I have a very high pain tolerance. But due to my ehlers danlos, I metabolize medication and it stops working very quickly. It’s about 12 days since the initial injury and the dilaudid is only about 60 percent effective at this point. Better than nothing but still, I’d like it be more effective. 

I was thinking about taking a “holiday” from it for a few days to see if that will up its efficacy. Is it safe to stop taking it after two weeks or is there a likelihood of dependency at that point? I have been through withdraws before (before my Chestwall surgery I was on opioids for about a year and weaned myself off with the support of my pain management doctor.) I really just want to stop cold turkey for a few days do reset my tolerance, but I don’t want to be in excruciating pain AND going through withdrawals. Please let me know your thoughts and experiences. 

Also, is there anyway if I switch up the pain meds, see if my pain management Dr can prescribe oxy or Vicodin or something, but I don’t know if just switching the medication will be effective if I’m already experiencing a lack of efficacy in the dose, and they’re all the same class of drugs. Any answers are GREATLY appreciated. 

Thanks so much!

"Hypocrisy, Generational Adiction/Trauma, and The Blame Game.","I want to start by saying that I wish there was a way to explain this all in a (TL,DR) kind of way, but there are so many moving parts, different time lines, and fingers being pointed that I apologize in advance for how long  and thorough this is all is..

Basically, as a child I always knew my family wasn't normal. My father tool long trips, I wouldn't sleep some of those nights when I knew he was expected home. Id climb the cupboards searching for frosting, cake frosting, or any other sugary sweets. I learned be stealth like, quiet, careful, controlling my breathe. Who knows if my likness of sweets that late while waiting was some sort of coping mechanism, but that video games, music, and other adrenaline pumping activities became a fixation for me.

As I got older I noticed my parents fighting alot, My older brother beating on me and being extremely cruel as his own form of entertainment and amusement for his friends and himself..

Now at this point in my life I could hardly hear or speak well. There was a cyst in my left ear feared to be cancerous. Maybe this is why i latched onto my father like I did, who knows, I'm no psychological scholar, just something I studied for days, sometimes weeks at a time later in life after being diagnosed with so many different mental illnesses ranging from Conduct Disorder to MDD and GAD.

I wanted to be just like my father, emulated his every mannerism, tone of voice, speaking style, etc. I never felt entirely close to my mother though, more of an obligation or a nusciance. A doll to dress up, a prop in her life really and this feeling multiplied after the divorce.

My brother was always quick to make friends, slightly michevous, clever, but not very book smart, manipulative, and prone to lying, creating entire scenarios out of thin air to justify his own misdeeds. Regardless, after the divorce, I felt like we had to stick together. 

(I'm gonna jump around alot to help better understand the behavior of my family members)

Our mother, was a bartender, a server, a caretaker, etc. Jobs that many housewives might take on to help with finances or to excercise some independence, but overall she always had a habit of finding men, successful ones, and latching to them, using whatever skills of manipulation, sex appeal, gaslighted, etc these men into feeling lucky to have her, although eventually they'd all cheat on her. She has very up and down emotional fits, small digs at your self esteem, etc to the point where she over played her hand and these men would find other means of release. 

She grew up in a household with an abusive alcoholic father, he would, according to her, best her three brothers, and ""emorionally"" abuse her.
Those three uncles went on to develop alcoholism as well and all died from it, she's what her own therapist referred to as a ""weekend warrior"" and as fate would have it, this is where she met her partners (my father, and her current BF, cocaine also played a heavy role in the first relationship with my father) they met in a bar my aunt (father's side) and her husband owned up until a stabbing outside the bar lost her the business after she divorced her husband.

Point being, this was sort of a survival pattern for my mother, but at least imo, her trauma would never allow her to be content with or even really understand how to just be a normal, stable housewive/mother. There always had to be some sort of problem, overreaction, or chaos, probably stemming from her own childhood experiences.

Now let's jump to me at about age 12, my brother and Inare latched kids. My father agreed to double child support payments on top of alimony so long as my mother agreed to stay home and raise us herself. No additional employment. She chose to become a bartender anyway on top of the extra income agreed upon.

I found myself covering for my brother constantly smoking weed, doing coke, drinking, cigarettes, pills and who knows what else (later we found out he had tried crack by age 15)

It was my responsibility to narc on him, but being alone with him there meant I would get the shit kicked out of me, faux strangling to the point of unconsciousness, shoved into a dryer and having it turned on, locked in car trunks, small closets, etc.

One day around age 14 I just woke up and on my way to the end of the street to get picked up for summer camp, I completely lost all control and beat the mailbox with my bare fists until they were bloody and through the backpack onto the roof. I felt so empty and depressed for the first time. Like I was becoming aware of how fucked up and unfair my life was. Idk what triggered it but I just couldn't take it anymore.

I never did a drug or drank a day in my life, I wanted so badly to get all straight A+s and get out of the life i was stuck in. But I was losing control of it all emotionally. I had to go to therapy, but that didn't seem to help much. At that age and onward many girls were interested in me but the fear of my mother and just how alien I felt kept me from really pursuing them back. I was such a confused, lonely and frustrated kid. 

My mother would constantly tell us our father didn't want us, he would breakdown drunk in front of me during visits and tell me how sorry he was for ruining everything. Life just sucked man. 

For the first time I felt completely out control like no matter how well I did in school, what job I ended up with what friends, or anything would make any of it better. Part of me loved my family so much, I was that naive kid who wanted to believe that one day dad would walk back through the door and all woukd be right again. Big happy Disney ending ya know?

But that isn't what happen, word got around school who and how my brother was, my mother and my father, I was picked on constantly and finally had to fight back. 

From that day foreword I started to always fight back not just with fists, but with words, with actions. I tried to take whatever control I could in anyway I could just never drugs or alcohol, however then internet became huge and porn became a central part of my life.

I literally fiendishly waited to go home and watch it for hours at a time. It got bad too. At first like any 14-15 year old male kid, just seeing tit's and ass was insanely riveting, but then I found out about lesbians? But even that too got dull, so I kept inching away at riskier and more taboo categories to the point where I was confused about my own sexualality. I felt so embarrassed because in real life I knew i wouldn't ever and couldn't do the things that seemed to turn me on in the moment. It was such a weird, confusing time that went on for years. I'd get heavy guilt then watch lesbian porn to ""even"" it out I guess? 

(Jumping forward several decades I realized the less I watched porn the more I'd stay at just normal porn, or none at all, and the less I watched the more natural I felt around women, whereas doing the opposite made me feel extremely guilty and like she must know somehow) 

Aside from video games and maybe caffinated soda this was my only addiction but much much stronger.

Around this time I experimented with weed and got caught pretty much immediately.  I got it from my bro and I brought it to school for a girl who liked me. I had a reputation that stemmed from my brother and family so she thought she needed to like weed for me to like her.

Her preppy friends found out and I was caught, during after school help of all things. 
She lied for me, but all my ""friends"" snitched immediately even though at this point I smoked weird maybe once or twice lol.

I got expelled and forced into a school with drug abusers, criminals, the mentally ill, etc.  my chances at a normal life were slipping away pretty fast.

Anyway I went on regular schooll eventually, my brother had his first kid, I finally lost my virginity despite my mother drilling it into my head that I ""better not knock any girl up and I'm not having any sex in her household!""

She was into percocet though, and honestly I didn't find her that attractive so it was a perfect way to slide out of the relationship guilt free, so I did. Lots of my freind were into pills around this time but I steered clear reading online that it was basically legal heroin.

Despite that, I felt like I would probably love opiates from the way they were described.
I was still very depressed too, working out and gaining more friends helped but my first percocet made me feel this incredible hope like maybe life could be goof after all so I begged my friends to keep them away from me. This was like right around the time that ""Relapse"" CD by Eminem came out and all the sudden everyone was doing OCs and Percocet, and on a few rare occasions, I even saw smack being lined up. (Who woulda known this would become normal a few years later)

*I guess at this point I'll speed up the story*

Basically, I got my first job, started doing blues (perc 30s) went to rehab 3 months later, learned about heroin, reached out to an aquantience from rehab a year later  when I relapsed, and started picking up dope to bring back to my small town where dope dealers were treated like rap stars. There were only a few of us and single bags went for 10-20, my competition was pissed cuz I did deals at 80 a bun and 10 a bag. I was charged 400 a stack (double what it costs) so I was using ripped off and still making 600 profit a stack. I did about 2-4 bags a day 7 was the most I ever did back then in a single day.

Eventually I got a sick of it all and paranoid about being arrested so I hit rehab again. Eventually I went on to go to rehab over 10 times and met a girl or two everytime. It became a habit in it of itself.

-‐-----------‐--------------------------------------
Okay so now let's jump to now...
----------------------------------------------------

My bro went to jail ended up there for 2 years for fraud, almost lost his kids, got them back and turned his life around. He's been clean for 10 years

My mom cut down on the drinking, upped on the food, her bf who owns a business and apartments cheats on her but she's in a denial. Not sure if she cares or not though, just think she knows how to play the system, not hard to see where my bro gets it from..

2 years ago I had a nervous breakdown after my freind killed his father an hour after dropping me off at my car and I found out my ex gf died randomly by searching her name on Google, add some conspiracy YouTube vids and multiply that by a nightshift job and psychosis hit me hard.

I managed to use a purposeful relapse to tap into state resources and get back on my feet.

I fell for a girl In rehab pretty hard and we relapsed together on f fentynal. I begged my mother for a rental so I could hustle money for a car note. I did Uber eats every waking hour while working at FedEx warehouse, used rhe fentanyl to work through It all, PF to take showers while living out of th rental, got accepted at an Amazon DSP and worked 5-6 days a week. 

Payed off the rental and got the new car, saw her once in a while, and racked up money to find a room to rent.
 
2 years later I was the sole name of the lease 10K in the bank 10K In My 401k new car 2024, and while all this time Mt family knew I was on fentynal they chose this Christmas to cut me out of their lives. Saying ""you looked so high"" even though for a year and half my brother had no idea I was getting high lmao. Suddenly now it's always been obvious.  My mom doesn't want me around anymore, guess I'm a dissapoinemnt now. Idk man to me?

When you consider everything I was forced to deal with despite just wanting a normal life, how am.i supposed to feel? For 2 and half years this was all fine, now apparently for 3 months it's ""been obvious""? 

It's the winter, I work at Amazon driving, we always look like shit around this time not to mention my SAD and trouble sleeping. This is the only year I've worked 5 days a week also. Its catching up with me. We've had guys and girls take entire months Inna row off for this very reason. It's a demanding job. But what really upsets me is that none of them seem to understand their roles or accept how their shifty choices effected me. I get high to not want to die everyday, for stamina, and for the tiny bit of euphoria I get from it. That's my business, they say to be an adult and suck it up, but then try to tell me how to live and judge tf outta me. 

For the first time in my life I genuinely don't care and kind of feel relieved that I don't have to care anymore. Fuck em. 

Can anyone relate to this?

Question about withdrawal,"I know this is unorthodox, but my mother died a few years ago from what I assume was opiate withdrawal and I am trying to see if it sounds plausible. I’ll explain- at the time of her death, I was aware she had been addicted to opiates and she had mental health issues as well, so I was surprised when my father told me she had died of a heart attack or stroke. I recently discovered that he lied to me and that he had no idea what she died from as he had me sign for no autopsy (I was her next kin). He had encouraged her to abuse her pain medication, starting her addiction, and no one but me knows that. She had lost her 2 forms of income in the six months prior to her death and my younger brother reported she had been really sick last few weeks of her life. She had diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue. She had died suddenly in a hallway of her apartment. I know it’s weird to ask this but I am trying to get closure by understanding what happened to my mother. She had issues but she was an incredible, smart, and loving person and I want to know if this is what may have ended her life.

Impacted Stool: Update,"Hey everyone, first of all Merry Christmas!

Last week I made a post about some concerning medical issues about not being able to shit for over a week an a half.

Monday I went to the ER because I was experiencing some significant abdominal pains. They performed a CT scan and it turns out that pounding miralax for nearly 4 days straight  completely liquified the moderately sized hard stool inside me.

They told me not to worry, I won't need to be disimpacted manually. Just stop taking the laxative and poop normally. 

Well today my bowels decided to push everything through. In the middle of my family's Christmas party, I was laying *hot steamy mud for nearly 30 min* in two different sessions. 

Wow! What a difference I felt immediately afterwards.

From now on I will make sure I am taking enough fiber and more preventative measures to keep this from happening in the future. 

I had a lot of responses on my first post and I wanted to update everyone on how it went down. 

Thanks for the advice everyone and I hope you all have a happy new year!",15,18,2024-12-26 06:20:02,impacted stool update hey everyone first merry christmas last week made post concerning medical issues able shit week half monday went er experiencing significant abdominal pains performed ct scan turns pounding miralax nearly 4 days straight completely liquified moderately sized hard stool inside told worry wo n't need disimpacted manually stop taking laxative poop normally well today bowels decided push everything middle family 's christmas party laying hot steamy mud nearly 30 min two different sessions wow difference felt immediately afterwards make sure taking enough fiber preventative measures keep happening future lot responses first post wanted update everyone went thanks advice everyone hope happy new year

Best options for quitting oxy,"Hey guys, I've been using oxycontin daily for about 5 years, over that time I've managed to indulge in 40mg oxycontin everyday and on very rare occasions or celebrations I might treat myself to 2 in a day (80mg) 

I'm ready to quit and give it up due to the costs, 1x 40mg oxycontin cost me about $100 aud so my weekly cost is around $700 

I've managed to keep myself on 40mg without going over for years and years despite it not having the magic it used to have in hopes that I won't ruin it for myself and I think I've done well in keeping to a low dose. The past few months I've noticed that I'm beginning to crave it a bit more or 2 times a day and with the cost of things it's just not manageable 

My question is how do I give myself the best chance at quitting and how long does withdrawals last? 

I've never really gone through withdrawals really and whenever I've felt it I fix myself up so I'm not to sure how bad it's going to be co spidering the low amount of withdrawal time I've experienced was agony

So I just want to give myself the best chance and will welcome on any advice to help me, is the withdrawal severity based on the amount you take or the overall time you've been taking it or a mix of both? I was hoping it will be easier for me because I have kept myself on such a low dose but also I've taken it for so many years that might not change anything

It would be nice if people had a better idea of the fact that the biggest dangers related to opioids are overdose and addiction, and both of them exist in deeply social contexts.

"Found 4 old 5mg oxycodone pills in my medicine cabinet, now I can’t stop thinking about it","I found my stepmoms old oxy script for some surgery a few months ago. It was a 5 pill no refill  bottle and there was 4 left. It was prescribed in May of this year so obviously she wasn’t using them anymore. But I’m still ashamed for taking them.

I took one pill and sat on it for 6 hours to see how I would react. I also tapped the cart a bit. I felt it a tiny bit but was paranoid about nodding or oding until I did some googling and realized 5mg ain’t gon do shit lmao especially since I’m 6ft 200lb.

I ended up crushing up and snorting the other 3 within 2 hours and tapped the cart a few more times. And yea I had a really good fucking time. No wonder this subreddit loves oxy’s so much. 

I did this late at night and I had work at 4pm. And man did I feel like a million bucks. Even tho I took them like 12 hours ago, I still felt amazing like a whole new person. Though it all faded later that evening.

I have zero opioid experience before this. I’m worried now since it’s been 4 days since I done it and I still can’t stop thinking about it. Like I’m already considering kratom and possible ordering online to satisfy this craving. 

I’m not a dumbass though, and I know the alternate universe version of me that’s 15 years older and a disgusting drug addict is practically begging me to just forget about it and focus on other things. But at the moment I have a raging curiosity.

EDIT: ok I’ve decided to just leave it alone completely and just stick to weed. I did some deep thinking and realized I love my life the way it is currently and if indulging in this means I lose everything then fuck that. I have no mental illness or any type of condition. So honestly I have no excuse to be doing it anyway.

Also I woke up today on Christmas morning and had no type of craving anymore which is so nice.

Do opioids really only make you care less about pain? Or do they actually reduce the feeling itself as well?,"I've never had the opportunity to use opioids for actual physical pain, since before I found them never got them prescribed, then I find them and immediately get hooked, then after 2-3 years of everyday use no dose does anything for physical pain (that I would attempt, at least), and for those 2-3 years never had any pain, so even for mild/moderate daily pains like a flu or whatever I've never used them, nsaids have always worked.

But I'm extremely curious, because I see a lot of people saying that they don't really take away the pain, they just make you care less about it. Which isn't really in accordance with most studies that I've been reading, when for example IV morphine or fentanyl is used for even quite severe pains, like broken bones and what not, and the pain not unusually goes from a 9/10 to a 3 or 4/10 after 10-20 minutes or so, which is a huge difference right? So how can this be related to only caring less about the pain?

Whereas nsaids (when they work) people do tell that they actually remove the pain (or part of it).

As a side note, it's also interesting that after stalking pulmonary embolism and kidney stone forums, due to health fears, it was very common to hear the story of ""morphine/fentanyl injection didn't do anything to me at the ER, but as soon as they injected the ketorolac (a potent nsaid) the pain was all gone"". Of course for some people it's the opposite, the ketorolac does nothing and only the opioids work. But for some reason I feel like the former are in higher numbers, aka I sometimes feel that opioids may be overrated, just from the many empirical cases that I've read over the years. I feel like strong IV nsaids are stronger, as well as ketamine (yes, in low doses it seems to be an excellent painkiller.)",0,40,2024-12-26 02:12:37,opioids really make care less pain actually reduce feeling well 've never opportunity use opioids actual physical pain since found never got prescribed find immediately get hooked 2-3 years everyday use dose anything physical pain would attempt least 2-3 years never pain even mild/moderate daily pains like flu whatever 've never used nsaids always worked 'm extremely curious see lot people saying n't really take away pain make care less n't really accordance studies 've reading example iv morphine fentanyl used even quite severe pains like broken bones pain unusually goes 9/10 3 4/10 10-20 minutes huge difference right related caring less pain whereas nsaids work people tell actually remove pain part side note 's also interesting stalking pulmonary embolism kidney stone forums due health fears common hear story `` morphine/fentanyl injection n't anything er soon injected ketorolac potent nsaid pain gone '' course people 's opposite ketorolac nothing opioids work reason feel like former higher numbers aka sometimes feel opioids may overrated many empirical cases 've read years feel like strong iv nsaids stronger well ketamine yes low doses seems excellent painkiller

Parasocial Relationships and recognizing use through the lens,"I woke up early this Christmas morning to my toddler being scared of fireworks. I couldn't go back to sleep and decided to hop on the computer.

Perusing YouTube I decided to check on one of my favorite content creators. Still no upload. Strange. I go to their most recent video and open the comments.

The day of the upload many people raised an eyebrow. One of the people on this channel was clearly high. I was one of the first to recognize it and call it out as I was watching the video within 30 minutes of upload. I wasn't judging the guy. I was just being honest and if anything thought I'd enjoy a conversation with him just as a fellow opioid enjoyer. I didn't know for sure he was into them, but when watching the video I was fairly certain. We know the look. Anyways I finished the video, and my gaming, and eventually went to bed.

This morning I discovered that night the person in question overdosed and died. I immediately got a lump in my throat and ran to my comment history trying to find my comment hoping to god I was mistaken and maybe I actually made the comment after he had overdosed. Nope. I was in fact one of the earliest ones to mention it.

I know many of you are thinking that I am being silly or dramatic. Perhaps. I have always felt guilt to be the heaviest burden to bear. But, without giving any identifying details, I have a LOT in common with the people on this specific channel. I spent a LOT of time consuming what they create. They are people with good character and wisdom and are people I look up to in a few different ways. I identify with them. 

I don't 100% know why I am posting this. Maybe I just need to get it off my chest. Maybe I am trying to make up for what I feel is a wrongdoing of some kind. Maybe I want someone to tell me I am an asshole. I don't know.

What I do know, this early Christmas Morning, is that we should all look at our loved ones with as much forgiveness and grace as we can muster for life is short, unpredictable, rough, rude, and ridiculous.

Tell the people you love that you love them. And if you feel like nobody loves you remember that there are people who love you that have never met you.

"You aren't ""clean"" you are abstinent","The way we talk about opiates and opioids needs to change. Calling someone “clean” because they’ve stopped using these substances is not only stigmatizing—it’s inaccurate and harmful.

Here’s why this matters:

Not all use is addiction. Opiates (natural substances like morphine and codeine) and opioids (synthetic or semi-synthetic drugs like oxycodone and fentanyl) are used for pain relief, recreation, or dependency management. Assuming all users are “dirty” creates unnecessary shame.

“Clean” implies moral judgment. Using opioids or opiates doesn’t make someone “dirty.” This language unfairly paints all use—whether recreational, medical, or dependent—as negative or immoral.

It erases nuance. Dependence, addiction, and responsible use are different experiences. Using judgmental terms like “clean” oversimplifies these distinctions and stigmatizes everyone.


The better word to use is “abstinent.” It’s neutral, factual, and doesn’t carry the moral or emotional baggage of “clean.”

By changing how we talk about opioid and opiate use, we can foster a more supportive and respectful environment—one that acknowledges the complexity of these substances and the people who use them.

Words matter. Let’s focus on respect, not stigma.

Kratom is... better than I remember?,"Hey all. Merry Christmas!

So since I had 3 months in a row where my Oxycodone 15mg wasn't in stock and I couldn't save extra- my brother gave me Kratom. Years ago I remember when I had bad withdrawals i purchased some which did help the withdrawals. I never took a big amount , mainly because it was a small bag of tablets. 


Anyway, this is the red one I guess the main strain speciosa mitro. So I saw doses range tremendously and some people say they take insane amounts. But I have 1/4 KG he gave me. It's tested and the brand checks out. 


So at night, I am able to skip both my final dose of Adderall , Oxycodone and Valium. I take 16 tablets so 8g. It says to take 4 tablets but I see online that has stimulant effects in low doses. 


I don't understand why this isn't a medicine in the US and I do understand why it's used in Asia. I am on SO many medications for adhd, cPTSD and chronic pain. This seems to be a miracle drug. 


For me, it is like taking a high dose of caffeine, mixed with a Vicodin and a very high dosage of Valium. I do take a few extra tablets sometimes so it's between 7g-10g. I use it to replace my final dosages so I save pills for backorder issues. 


I'm so used to all my medications I don't feel ""high"" anymore. I just feel okay. The Kratom works sooo fast and since I take it at night I don't need it to last too long. But i just wanted to say it's not a placebo like some told me. 


I'm  not wanting to raise my tolerance so I take it by itself. And I get the well-being feeling that the ""peak"" of Oxycodone brings me but it seems to maintain itself for about 2 hours. It helps with sleep and helps my neck and back pain. 


TLDR;


This stuff is a miracle. It genuinely helps me not require my final dosage of all three medications. At this amount it has both stimulant and pain relieving effects. It truly is much better than I remembered and expected.

Promethazine (green) and oxy ,"Am I good? 

My buddy gave me a line of ""green"" about an hour ago, which I know it's just promethazine without the codeine and I just took a 30mg pharma oxy without realizing it could interact negatively. 

I have a decent tolerance to oxy as some days I'll take up to 210mg throughout the day, but hardly ever drink promethazine.

Can somebody explain to me how taking a full opioid agonist like oxycodone or fentanyl can bring on precipitated withdrawal if you’re already taking Suboxone? ,"As I understand it, Suboxone contains buprenorphine and naloxone. The naloxone binds to opioid receptors and prevents them from being activated by other opiates. Similarly, buprenorphine binds to these same receptors, but only partially activates them. It also binds much stronger to the receptor than other full opioid agonists (oxycodone, heroin, etc). 

I understand why precipitated withdrawal would occur if the oxycodone were taken first (because the buprenorphine would bind to the occupied receptors but produce a weaker effect), but I don’t understand how it works the other way around. If buprenorphine binds more tightly to other receptors, wouldn’t taking another opiate simply just have zero effect? What is the mechanism I’m missing here?

"I hate that I'm much more mentally stable on opioids, for 7 years already","Even though I stopped (or stopped being able to afford) getting high only after 2 or 3 years, I'm still way more mentally stable. I think I've always been dopamine deprived. And then I started taking benzos everyday due to life problems, and became straight anhedonic, unable to get pleasure from anything. Starved of pleasure. Then suddenly you discover these cheap pills with no hangover or any bad side effects that make you feel absolutely godly... How can you not fall for it?

But even though I still feel much more mentally stable today, I still regret it. For one thing: these things don't fuck any organ like most other drugs, but they fuck your brain's dopamine production and pain management system. So if you ever stop you'll become much more dopamine deprived than ever (for 6-24 months, the so called PAWS, but some people just never quite heal), plus you'll become less resistant to pain, plus opioids won't work for pain management while on active addiction.

These are imo pretty bad things and totally not worth the trade off. I think maybe it would have been worth it if I had stayed at a low dose, like 50mg of oxy a day or equivalent, and definitely never mess with methadone/subs which really mess your receptors, or so I suspect. Plus also adding a tolerance reversing drug from the start, like agmatine or ULDN.

I know these are like first world problems to those living in North America, which is becoming more and more third world (the fentanyl problem, among many others), but for those of us in Europe where it's still possible to acess safe opioids, I give the advice of never getting hooked.

I just wanted to say that whether you're surrounded by family, or alone in the cold and struggling, I am thinking about you and you are loved. 

The holidays can be a strange time for an addict.

Christmas is no different, and it's always a struggle to work a habit around everything, but we manage.

Relapse question,"I have been addicted to opioids for years. Heroin, suboxone, methadone you name it. I quit the hard stuff 1.5 years ago and replaced it with kratom. Eventually, that spiraled out of control as well to the point of using 50-70 grams a day for the last 6 months. A few days a week I also added subs/methadone/heroin to the mix. I quit cold turkey a month ago and used suboxone for the first 5-7 days. Due to insomnia and anxiety, I have used lots of gabaergics and benzos (mainly phenibut and lyrica) for the past couple of weeks. Bad choice as upon quitting them a few days ago, I have had horrible mental rebound. Which together with the opioid paws have been hell. Yesterday I was completely burned out with hellish depression and anxiety and could do nothing but lay in bed. Figured I ""needed"" something to do the chores in preparation for christmas. Found a 8 mg suboxone and railed half of it up my nose. Felt fine after about 30 mins and did all my chores. Today I took the other half just to ""be fine on christmas"". You know how us addicts reason... Now I'm ashamed and also terrified of what this relapse might do to my progress. On to the questions:

1. How much will this 2 day relapse set me back after being off opioids completely for over 3 weeks? Will I be ""fine"" except for increased depression/anxiety/restlessness/insomnia for a couple of days? Or will I be back to full blown withdrawal?

2. How do I manage the cravings? It feels impossible for me not to relapse when I get these cravings. Having that utterly horrible withdrawal anxiety and knowing dosing will take care of it in an instant. I become a f*ckin robot, programmed to finding and dosing opioids! I have no one to talk to when shit gets rough, which makes it even harder to try and do it on my own. But I really want to get clean. But seems impossible with these long withdrawals and cravings :(

I understand there’s a huge issue with benzos and opioids, but my concern is why am I popping when I haven’t taken the medicine in so long? 

For additional information, I do take 60mg of Prozac daily, and Methocarbimal 250mg as needed. And I’ve read that these can cause a false negative. My doctor knows about my other meds, but was suspicious that I was lying abt taking any benzos. I’ve never failed a urine test before. Should I be worried the edibles I take are laced?

I saved my best friends life and he’s continuing to take if for granted ,About over a month ago in early November I get a call from one of my mud brothers M (What I call my 3 best friends sense I see them more as family then friends and every one else in my life are more  acquaintances to me) and he’s saying that my other Brother B is asleep in his passenger seat and not responding after taking half a pressed ten. I moved a 1000 miles away from my brothers in August to get clean and sort of better my life and I was the only one in the group with narcan and sense then I’ve been begging them to quit or at the very least get narcan themselves. Anyway M had taken a Q of the ten and was visibly out of it him self and didn’t really know what to do or what was going on. Thank god I had picked up the phone because I asked him to show me his finger tips which had gone purple so I told him to drive him to the hospital which was only 5 minutes from where they were and told him to give me the phone to the people at the desk where I then explained the situation and saved that lil niggas life sense he had OD’D off the half. To give context he takes 30s everyday (Around 1 1/2-3 depending on his money) but the ten he copped was a hot pocket and damn near took him off the map. He took so little care in the fact that he almost lost his life he fucking gave me a review on how the other half smacked him when he took it that night after coming home from the hospital. He continues to take 30s every day and he’s scaring the fuck out of me because he hasn’t even taken the time to get narcan or do anything to help him self claiming he dosent get withdrawals and can stop whenever he feels like it and how he doesn’t want to hear my 2 cents cause I was addicted for longer then him before I quit. I know there’s probably nothing I can do but tell his mom sense we talk often and I’ve been holding it down and lieing to her but it just scares and upsets me man.,16,18,2024-12-23 09:53:30,saved best friends life ’ continuing take granted month ago early november get call one mud brothers call 3 best friends sense see family friends every one else life acquaintances ’ saying brother b asleep passenger seat responding taking half pressed ten moved 1000 miles away brothers august get clean sort better life one group narcan sense ’ begging quit least get narcan anyway taken q ten visibly self ’ really know going thank god picked phone asked show finger tips gone purple told drive hospital 5 minutes told give phone people desk explained situation saved lil niggas life sense od ’ half give context takes 30s everyday around 1 1/2-3 depending money ten copped hot pocket damn near took map took little care fact almost lost life fucking gave review half smacked took night coming home hospital continues take 30s every day ’ scaring fuck ’ even taken time get narcan anything help self claiming dosent get withdrawals stop whenever feels like ’ want hear 2 cents cause addicted longer quit know ’ probably nothing tell mom sense talk often ’ holding lieing scares upsets man

Is 300mg codiene phosphate the same as 30mg oral oramorph?,"Basically been having a rough time dealing with withdrawals as I've just had codiene. It just hasn't been affecting me at all and I've been needing to take like 25+, 12 tablets at once, split over the whole day. 

It just hasn't been doing anything for my withdrawals. 

So I decided to get a bottle of oramorph, but I didn't realise how stupidly low the bioavailability is. 

Online it says that 300mg codiene is 30mg morphine. But morphine has a stupidly low bioavailability. 

Ive not got a great understanding of bioavailability. 

It says codiene has a bioavailability of 60% and morphine 20-25%. Would that mean I'm technically getting more morphine from the codiene ?

Self-Administration of Naloxone,"Hey guys, I want to share a story about how I ended up in the hospital after smoking weed and administering Naloxone on myself. Basically, it was straight-up torture—like setting your body on fire. You can literally feel your bones burning, your heart starts pounding like it’s going to jump out of your chest, and you get the worst panic attack of your life. You’re ready to say goodbye to everything because you don’t know if you’ll survive it.

Your brain feels like someone is hitting it with a hammer, and you can’t stop it. You can’t think straight because the pain is so overwhelming that the only thought you have is, ‘911, I think I’m dying.’

When the paramedics finally arrive,They tell you, ‘You’re fine, you’re just tripping, bro. Don’t do drugs.

P.S. I smoked a huge dab, got a massive panic attack, and thought I was overdosing.

21 Grams of Fentanyl To Remember You By,"# Everybody Was My Friend…Until They Became My Customer.

The year draws to a close, and the ritual of taking stock begins. Not of inventory, not of profit margins, but of the faces that still grace this mortal coil. A grim audit of survival. For some, loss is a distant echo, a faded photograph in a dusty album. For me, it's a constant companion, a phantom limb that aches with every passing day. In the opioid game, intimacy arrives with brutal speed. Your confidantes become casualties. Your allies turn to whispers in the shadows, trading loyalty for a fix, or worse, *a deal with the devil in blue*.

The streets are paved with broken promises and the ghosts of those who OD'd in trap houses. You think you're clever, a puppet master pulling the strings of fate, mastering the alchemy of oblivion. Like that professor in ""*Candy,*"" you delude yourself into believing you're bringing solace, a temporary reprieve from the crushing weight of existence. But the truth, a bitter pill I’ve swallowed countless times, is this:

***Everybody was my friend… until they became my customer.***

*The Illusion of Control*

I could give it away. I did give it away, countless times. Late nights, backroom deals, ""*hooking a brotha up*""—gestures of misplaced generosity, desperate attempts to blur the lines between friend and client. But the truth remained, etched in the haunted eyes of those who came to me: ***I wasn't a friend. I was the gatekeeper.*** The one who held the key to their fleeting euphoria, and, unknowingly, to their eventual ruin.

I told myself I was controlling the market, a benevolent drug lord setting fair prices, ensuring a steady supply. “*I’m the market*,” I’d whisper to the empty rooms, a pathetic mantra of self-justification. I wasn’t some *Bindle 'N Bundle Bernanke*, manipulating interest rates of misery. I was the *architect of their dependence,* the *engineer of their destruction.* In the desolate landscape of my conscience, *only the ghost of Albert Speer kept me company*.

Where are they now, those faces from 2006, 2007? The ones who laughed with me, shared secrets, dreams? Gone. Vanished like smoke in the wind. Robert Graves had it right: ""*Goodbye to All That*.""

It’s not the abstract guilt of contributing to a national crisis that haunts me. It’s the *personal toll*, the faces I can no longer see, the voices I’ll never hear again.d It’s the first cut, the deepest, the one that sets the pattern for all the others. It’s the way relativity twists the knife: the closer they were, the sharper the pain. What does it mean to know that something you created, this fire you unleashed, reached out and consumed those closest to you? That’s my story. A cautionary tale for anyone who dreams of playing El Chapo with the universe.

***December 29, 2004***

Before I was fully initiated into this brotherhood of selling suffering wholesale to gangs and distros, I knew its sting. My cousin, just two years older, a whirlwind of restless energy, had barely tasted freedom after a stint in county jail. His ""*Booster Bragging Rights*""—a juvenile escapade involving a stolen encrypted radio, an AR15 from a police cruiser, a military armory and stolen Javelin rocket launchers—had landed him there. Now, he was back, trying to find his footing, trying to outrun the demons that clung to him like shadows. He was working his way back up to 80 mg of Oxy, chasing the phantom of oblivion. That afternoon, he scored 40 mg of Methadone. One tablet. One dose. One fatal arrhythmia.

I was seventeen, a kid playing adult in a world I didn’t understand. My dad, bless his practical soul, had made sure we were all lifeguard certified. I knew CPR. I remember the frantic compressions, the forced breaths, the ""*Ice Queen*""—my aunt Theresa—taking over, her face a mask of frozen terror. I remember his saliva, still warm on my lips. He was gone. His bowl of cheerios lying spilled onto the floor. Leaking out, like his life force. Just like that. The weight of his lifeless body in my arms, the echo of his last breath, the image of his eyes, fixed and vacant—these are the memories that claw at me in the dead of night.

The train of devastation, the *Fentanyl Zephyr*, a phantom express carrying the weight of all my sins wasn't finished with me. It never is. It’s a ghost train that circles back like a celestial orbit, its mournful whistle echoing through the desolate landscape of my heart. It doesn't care about calendars or celebrations; it operates on its own cruel timetable. Years later, under the oppressive weight of another December night, it pulled into *Deandra Station* again, bringing with it another cargo of grief.

\---------------------------------------------------

***December 8, 2011***

A decade later. Another December. Another loss. Today is a day I try to erase from the calendar, a black hole in the fabric of time. The 1975’s “*Somebody Else*” plays on some random radio station and it all comes rushing back.

The memory of his last kiss, the cold saliva on even colder lips. That morning, he’d texted me, full of life, talking about steak dinners and my upcoming birthday. I’d sent him back a Gwen Stefani lyric, a desperate, unspoken plea: *I’d kill a dozen Santa Clauses, steal his sleigh, and come back home to you*. A hollow promise in retrospect.

That night, the aroma of beef brisket filled the air, a comforting scent that usually signaled warmth and connection. My favorite. He knew me so well. I called his name, the sound echoing strangely in the quiet house, as I began preparing the green beans, a familiar domestic ritual. Fifteen minutes ticked by, an eternity in the growing silence. A flicker of unease crept in. Maybe he was lost in the digital battlefield of *Call of Duty*, oblivious to the world outside the screen? I went to the man cave, a space usually buzzing with the sounds of virtual warfare. It was empty, a hollow echo chamber. A chill ran through me as I wandered back upstairs, drawn by a sliver of light spilling from an open door at the end of the dark hallway.

And that's where I found him. Lifeless. No breaths. No pulse. Cold, clammy skin. The frantic 911 call, the chest compressions, the Narcan, the Doxapram—a desperate, futile dance with death. ***How much epi in a code***? My mind screamed, but the knowledge was useless, a cruel mockery in the face of the inevitable. I had a literal pharmacy at my fingertips in my medic bag, but all the king's potions can't bring my Humpty back. I held him, tears streaming down my face, mingling with the coldness of his skin. ***Blue Lips, Pale Fingertips.*** The whispers began, the same insidious voices that haunted Hamlet, echoing in my mind: ***You’re too late. You’re too late. You’re too late.***

The contents of the safe, the evidence of my trade, went into a garbage bag. A ritual of destruction, a desperate attempt to erase my culpability. The charcoal briquettes, the lighter fluid, the match—*a moth drawn to the flame of my own guilt*.

***Twenty-one grams of fentanyl, reduced to ash, rising like a macabre phoenix from the flames, a twisted echo of Sadako's paper cranes, carrying his soul away from me, away from the world I had helped to destroy.***

When my time comes, will there be a Ferryman willing to guide this wretched soul across the River Styx? Or will I be left to wander the shores of regret, haunted by the faces of those I’ve lost, forever trapped in the echo of their last breaths?

*End the Drug War, so that monsters like me don't have to exist.*

morphine and lamotrigine ,"Hi! I'm taking lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer in two doses daily, 25mg each. I recently started using morphine recreationally, I wonder if lamotrigine affects the opioid high in any possible way? Should I skip my lamotrigine dose the day I'm planning to get high?

Black tar ,"Hello I have a question, my cat purchased some bth from west coast first time it passed simple cvs fent test negative. Second time it popped for fent but I also don’t know how to properly test it. I just put like .05 in the cup with 5ml of water and let the strip absorb for 15 seconds and it tests for fent. What my question is, is if it has that bitter taste when I lick my fingers just like BTH and smells strongly of BTH you know that vinegar nasty smell. There has to some actual BTH in this right? Or is it this fake stuff everyone’s talking about from Mexico?? It’s not the wet goopy stuff I seen other people post it’s your typical hard tar you break off little chunks.

"Impacted stool, any solutions?","Sup everyone? So, long story short I haven't had a proper shit in a week. Yesterday I went to the urgent care and after some X-rays the doctor said that yes I have a ""moderate amount of feces"" in my system. 

But since I'm not experiencing pain she deferred sending me to the ER, she prescribed me miralax to drink for a couple days until I pass it naturally. But I'm getting wickedly impatient and I just want this poop to come out of me.

I have tried literally everything! Miralax like a mf, enemas, suppositories, weird colon massages to get the poo out and nothing is working.

Do lab tests detect longer than rapid tests?,"I go to pain management and ran out of my regular meds early (we're adjusting meds) and used a fentanyl patch, 50mcg, to help with the withdrawal. I'm on methadone.. the withdrawals are awwfullll.  I took the patch off on the 10th, and my Dr's office sends the urine to a lab. If I'm tested on the 26th, would the lab test detect the fentanyl? I did use an at home test and it came back negative, but I read the lab tests detect it at a way lower minimum amount if that makes sense.

I know I shouldn't have used it but I couldn't take the withdrawal and was too nervous to call the dr and let them know.

Anybody encountered issues with Proton pump inhibitors and codeine?,"Hi. Has anybody else encountered issues with codeine barely having any effect while using a proton pump inhibitor? I use codeine for migraine pain, since nothing else has helped yet, but we are exploring other options with my neuro still. Anyway, I'm using Esomeprazole for my GERD at the moment and it so happens that codeine effectiveness has taken a nose dive. I think I'm an ultra rapid metaboliser since even 30mg of codeine makes me high and gives me a lot of relief from serious migraine pain and nausea, that isn't relieved by anything else. Tolerance hasn't been an issue for 2 years now, but I barely feel anything right now, even from 60mg, pretty much since I started taking Esomeprazole. I found medical studies that show Esomeprazole acting as a weak CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor, that converts codeine to morphine, but it seems to completely kill any codeine conversion for me.

Physical dependence question ,"Heyy folks,

So, I have been abusing Tianeptine for a couple of months... Tried giving it up a couple of times but couldn't make it past 30 hours cause of the withdrawals.

Fast forward today, I'm 4 days off Tia. The worst of the withdrawals peaked at around the 24hour mark and then faded slowly to absolutely no symptoms at around the 60  hour mark.

Today, I'm completely free from withdrawals.

I have 150mg of Morphine left from an old batch, I was wondering How long do I have to wait before I can use the morphine to avoid restarting the cycle of physical dependence? Cause I absolutely do not want to go down that hell hole again.

What looks like heroin but isn’t?,"What looks like heroin but isn’t?

Family member passed away one week ago.  He was found with a few bags of meth and one bag of “a black tarry substance”.  This “substance” tested negative for heroin and all other drugs on the panel.  The coroner doesn’t know what else it could be.  Any ideas on what it could have been? 

Young, physically healthy.  We knew he was microdosing meth and vaped tobacco.  He appeared to be sleeping when we found him, sitting upwards, but his eyes were slightly open and he was cold to the touch.  Autopsy was negative but still have to wait 3 weeks for toxicology…however they do suspect overdose.

I thought meth overdoses were not typical.  Any ideas?  What of the black tarry substance that tested negative for drugs?

Bupenorphine and Alcohol,"Who here takes Bupenorphine to quit drinking and also had a moderate opiate problem. 

I've been on Bupenorphine for two years. I'm weaning off because its given me horrible side effects such as low testosterone, bad depression, poor sleep, trouble urinating, constipation. I deal with those side effects with others medications but I still don't feel happy or like myself. So I'm down to 6mg bupe and jumping to 4mg next month. 

However, Bupenorphine is the only thing besides incarceration that has helped me stay sober from alcohol totally. I've been sober over two years and don't even desire to drink or be around people drinking. 

The Bupenorphine seems to act on the same receptors in the brain that alcohol affects. Yes I do feel dependent on the Bupenorphine and that's also why I want to get off. 

I have also abused pain killers. Never H or Fent. But my pain killer abuse was moderate and would only last up to a week if I had the source or a couple weeks if I had my own script. After the couple weeks I could stop taking them n did feel some withdrawal but not much. Id usually drink to deal. 

My drinkng problems tho were much more of a problem. 4x DUI which I did prison time for (7 Mos), relationship issues, went to work drunk a couple times, wake up and not stop drinking and just quit my job after conflict the previous day at work, saying and doing mean things that were not of my person at all, having sex with women I would never imagine seeing naked even lmao 🤣. They got a get some loving too, just glad I don't remember most of it besides passing out. 

So I'm just wondering who else here takes Bupenorphine or Suboxone to stay sober from alcohol mainly. I now am hearing providers tell me they use tt for people with alcohol disorder rather than just opiate addiction.

partner is 1 month sober! ,"Hey everyone.  

As the title says, my boyfriend has been sober from Percs and Oxys for the past 30 days. For the last 4 years, he’s been dealing with all types of painkillers, which led him to overdose and be hospitalized. Luckily, he survived after 3 consecutive heart attacks and was legally presumed dead for a couple of minutes.  

During his stay in the ER, he realized how much it had impacted me and his family life. To this day, he’s still trying to make amends and frequently apologizes by planning cute date ideas, which I missed a lot because the last 2 months were just a completely dark phase, especially with his excessive usage due to his paranoia, panic attacks, PTSD, and more.  

I know and I’m aware he has good intentions and wants to do better by my side every day, as well as for himself. But this event has impacted me a lot; the pain in his mom’s voice shattered my heart into pieces, and seeing him battle addictions in his hospital bed broke me.  

My father passed away a year before this incident happened with my partner.  I spent the evening at the ER, grieving. 

I hate the month of November now.  

To all my fellow friends who have been sober from opiates, can you please tell me how I should act towards him when he sometimes speaks about his urge to relapse?  

I tend to be emotional sometimes because I just think about those tragic events when he ""trauma dumps"" me from his POV. But I want to support him well. I love him dearly and I want to have a better approach. And yes, healing isn’t linear.  

I just feel like I’ve been on the edge lately, and I’m scared that I’m not helping his situation.

I think my friends Xanax is laced ,"For some reason I can't post in the benzodiazepine group so I figured I'd ask you guys since you'd probably be more knowledgeable. He gets totally knocked out from 0.5mg Xanax which he says is pharma but he gets it from a dealer. He says he even feels tired the next day from it. I told him that's a tiny dose and should only provide mild anxiety relief and not knock you out. He doesn't even have anxiety issues and only uses it as a sleep aid. I feel like his shit is laced with fent, zenes, or xylazine. Not sure how common that shit is in his country. I told him he should get it tested but he won't. Just looking out for him. Thoughts?

Ps  I also forgot to mention he said it leaves weird blisters or something in his mouth too. I've never heard of that...

What would happen?,"What do you think would happen/how would it impact + or -'s

if you country regulated/legalized opiates for recreational use.

as a basic framework i am thinking in the way of; you are able to go to either your doc/pharmacy and be able to buy pharmaceuticals to use, the main one that comes to mind is Dilaudid because i am on safe supply in Canada and that is what i have been getting and i think that is the most basic/most versatile one to use, you can easily crush to snort or shoot with better harm reduction aspects too because of that.

And not being a free program but just like other intoxicants you have to buy them, and because its not the black market you aren't paying 20 dollars for 1 D8. but the standard pharmacy cost.

and with their still being a limitation on how much you can get/up to the discretion of the provider like booze stores/bars. And on that note maybe even having like Opiate bars/Opium dens where you can go in and use, but have to stay for a certain amount of time or something so your not super fucked up out in public. (don't know how this would work, just an idea)

I genuinely believe that opiates would have a massive therapeutical benefit on the general public compared to resorting to drinking booze as a release after work/self medicating. where obviously booze mentally intoxicates you and takes you out of your body/actions. not remembering what you did the night before, saying/doing things you normally wouldn't etc etc.

of course its addictive and their would be some problems associated with it, but just like how we allow certain leeway with the negative effects of alcohol on the public like at bars, fights, sexual assaults, drinking and driving etc etc, its a risk we know of and try to mitigate the issues.

and people mainly think that because its an opiate that all of a sudden we will have massive influx of junkies who will quit their jobs and become the cliche homeless welfare junky. which i think is a false narrative of things to come if it were to become legalized. Of course their will be problems for people, but that is the benefit of it no longer being hidden away but being public where you can get help from friends and family free of guilt and stigma jsut like happens when someone has a drinking problem you know/love.

Not to mention all of the benefits that would also come from the regulation such as:

\-Eliminating the Billions/trillions of dollar s in profit for Mexican cartels, middle eastern terrorist groups (isis, Al-Q), South east Asia tri-ads/gangs, South American Cartels.  
\-Saving the billions/trillions from unnecessary medical demands from overdoses, hospital visits/Ambulance calls, physical/mental harm from Toxic/tainted/unsafe for human consumption ingredients.  
\-With the profits from the sale of the narcotics it can be put back into social services to help reduce factors that lead addictive personalities/mentalities, better schooling, social housing, better health care funding, etc etc.  
\-Saving countless lives from ODs, life altering damages, and a healthier/safer population.  
\-by treating it as health crisis/medical concern and not criminalizing usage ***REDUCES*** criminal charges/records which hinders people from being able to get decent employment, community relationships, education, prospects for improving their lives out of the cycle of poverty/addiction. This is ***NOT*** to say that this gives addicts carte blanche to do anything/everything they want without consequences like we kind of see now. If you commit a crime/habitually commit crime even after having a safe/affordable supply the problem is above and beyond an addiction crisis it is deeper rooted that needs to be addressed/treated/removed from the community in a ethical/humane/proper way, not just jail/hospitals or death (na/aa words)  
\- Mental health improvements of society through using opiates as a recreational support compared to alcohol, and all of the physical, mental and emotional growth that can come from using an opiate as a unwinder to be able to become more introspectable and analytical of ourselves and those around us and be able to be high enough to not over react or have a emotional spontaneous reaction to a situation/circumstance like might happen with alcohol.

Why the hell isn't Naloxone OTC everywhere?,"As someone using Kratom regularly and O-DSMT and Oxy occasionally, I never really researched let alone used Naloxone. Just out of curiosity I googled about its legal status and was shocked to see that in my home country (Germany) you can get Naloxone only with prescription.   
  
How fucked is that?   
To my knowledge Naloxone, even overdosed, doesn't do any harm apart from inducing withdrawal obviously, and and it clearly doesn't have any potential for abuse. So why would anyone want to discourage people from obtaining a potential lifesaver by putting it behind the prescription barrier?  
Seems like pure evil. Am I missing something here?

Apparently in the US you can get an OTC naloxone nasal spray since 2023, so I'm assuming before that it was prescription only, too.

"Which detox from fentanyl is less painful, using Methadone or buprenorphine ?","F30, 10+ yrs of heroin use (obviously found out its been mainly fentanyl the past 2-3 years. Xylazine detected too, I believe that's what really has made my body feel really sick.)  
Ideally, I don't want to be on anything and just detox completely.  
But, **I do not want to go to inpatient** (Ik it is the ideal option, but due to life circumstances, and honestly also had bad experiences with unsafe conditions/male staff.)

I recently did an at home detox following the same doses + meds as an inpatient detox: 7 day methadone taper (starting from 35mg, -5mg daily ). But relapsed almost immediately and have been back to using for these past 2 weeks since.  
I followed up on a hospital's referral to their chemical dependency department today. It advertised a buprenorphine 7-10 day detox, but I found out I must misunderstood the ""detox"" part. Not an ""outpatient detox"", its just an outpatient clinic similar to a methadone program (but with subs instead: sick for 2 days, come in daily for daily dose 7-10, once stabilized you get on script and don't need to come in daily, then slowly taper off over months). It's still something your body is dependent on, even if done with intention & motivation, will take some months to comfortably taper down and get completely off.)

The withdrawals using methadone to detox weren't the worst and I have experience with it (it changed my life before, but I can't deny ik it messes with my body. I just want to be free of having to be physically limited.) My only experience with subs is getting a script many years ago and I got sick as a dog likely from precipitated withdrawal. So **I have a lot of anxiety about subs having a more painful withdrawal process..** In my mind, if I need the willpower and go through the pain for 2 days, why not push through instead of just getting on something again that I'l have to withdraw from anyway (but drag it out longer..)?

I know there is no quick fix and both meds have changed peoples lives (methadone helped me when I hit rock bottom a few years ago), I understand I'll likely take months to feel ""normal"" again regardless and these meds are supposed to also help with cravings as you adjust and go down. But I'm so tired. Im worried about my body. That's why I desperately prefer not to drag this out in an outpatient clinic being uncomfortable for months only to just put off the withdrawal process anyway. BUT if tapering off subs even slowly is genuinely ""better"" than coming off methadone, I'm all for it.

I need out and I need to do something now. I've gotten to the point I can't stand the thought of when I next use, but im terrified of the physical wd (I can't take methadone atm as it stays in your system long in case I follow through with the subs appt after the weekend, so I want to make a decision ASAP..)  
Should I just stick with the 7 day methadone detox plan and push through a couple uncomfortable months to just get it over with. Or does anyone highly recommend a different method that didn't make you feel like death, even if it is the subs route..

"Depressed,anxious, & don’t feel like doing anything AT ALL; How to suggest diff meds to psych w out raising 🚩for “drug seeking behavior”","1 month clean from a year of daily use of xanax and heroin/fent. Continued smoking meth daily. Now on day 1 of no meth.

Been on suboxone and hydroxyzine for 1 month. Hasn’t really helped. I guess the suboxone makes things just tolerable enough.

Super depressed. Anxiety through the roof. Don’t feel like doing anything. Don’t even want to step foot outside. Haven’t cleaned the house in a month. Struggle to shower, eat, shave, get out the house. I only do when I have to work. On my days off I lie in bed all day smoking meth stuck on my phone. I told this to my psychiatrist. 

I just got prescribed 10mg each of Fluoxetine and Lurasidone. And they are going to add low dose of Wellbutrin next month.

I’m on day 1 no meth, but I feel like the benzo and opiate withdrawals a month later are still kicking my ass. I’ve read that gabapentin or pregabalin are known to help.

Oxycontin is the best anti depressent I've ever found ,"I'm going through a really rough period like severe depression. I can't even manage getting out of bed for days at a time which means I can't work. However when I snort oxy typically 20mg OG OC80 2-3x a day I'm filled with motivation and my depression literally disappears. I feel like a totally different human on it. Tbh I don't even feel high or fucked up. I just feel GOOD and a feeling of everything will be okay. BLISS. It helps tremendously with me being OK with this fucked living situation.

 I've decided I need to use it as a tool in low doses and it'll help me make maximum money so I can move out of my parents. My living situation is the cause of most my depression rn. For a while there I was abusing the fuck out of Xanax and yeah that is def not a good work drug. I was abusing it to just black out and escape. I did do 2mg Xanax with 15mg oxy first time in a week today and I must say I feel amazing. Anyone else experience the amazing anti depressent effects? I find it strange since it's technically a depressent so why's it helping me so much? Is it the dopamine rush. Love you guys.

Rank your opiate withdrawals,"I’m curious to know what your experience with different opiate withdrawals is. Specifically heroin, rx opiates (hydros, oxys, morphine, tramadol etc), fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine. If you have more feel free to add them. I’d contribute to the conversation but I’ve only experienced heroin withdrawals and I’m currently finding out how bupe is going to be. 

I normally hear methadone and fent take the top spot. Then bupe and heroin are relatively close, but bupe has an edge that heroin doesn’t and rx opiates aren’t very far behind.

Time warping and passing out on Tapentadol ,"Hi guys,

A few days ago I took about 1800mg of Tapentadol and 350mg or so of diphenhydramine (for the itchiness).

I remember taking more and more and not feeling any higher, but eventually I would find myself waking up after falling over in the kitchen after what I assumed to be passing out while standing up. Check the time and a couple hours have passed. It’s late so I go to sleep a little later and sleep well, but when I wake up I am super confused and believe I have missed a day, like waking up and having no idea how much time has passed.

Is this an OD? Is there a chance this could have killed me? I have a pretty decent opioid tolerance, but have not experienced this weird warping of time.

Thanks in advance!",2,6,2024-12-19 23:33:52,time warping passing tapentadol hi guys days ago took 1800mg tapentadol 350mg diphenhydramine itchiness remember taking feeling higher eventually would find waking falling kitchen assumed passing standing check time couple hours passed ’ late go sleep little later sleep well wake super confused believe missed day like waking idea much time passed od chance could killed pretty decent opioid tolerance experienced weird warping time thanks advance
"I did everything i could, but she still passed away ","My Best friend passed away at the beginning of this month. 

I don't and never have done opiates, but she was curious about them. She bought some H one day and she said it made her feel sick, so she wouldn't get anymore.

But she did buy more. She felt good this time. I felt sick. I felt sick because i was terrified my best friend would take something laced with worse drugs or she'd take too much or someone would hurt her.

I got myself two units of Naloxone for reversing overdoses long enough for the ambulance to arrive. I was trained how to use it. We got Nitazene testing strips to keep her safe from fentanyl. 

I couldn't look her in the eyes anymore. My best friend wasn't.. *there*, right now. She was a different person right now. We fought and argued because her usage was dragging me down too. I was using drugs more often and getting into trouble and i promised my SO I'd move out. 

I moved out. We stopped talking except for the occasional argument. She hadn't been online in several days and i was worried about her. I got a phone call from the police that day to tell me she'd passed away.

I found out a few days later it was apparently oxycodone that she'd tested for Nitazenes and then taken them anyway.

I don't know why I'm here or what i want from posting this. I just thought you guys would understand, yk.

Idk. Don't use alone. The naloxone could have saved her if someone else was wjth her to inject it.",43,16,2024-12-19 05:46:28,everything could still passed away best friend passed away beginning month n't never done opiates curious bought h one day said made feel sick would n't get anymore buy felt good time felt sick felt sick terrified best friend would take something laced worse drugs 'd take much someone would hurt got two units naloxone reversing overdoses long enough ambulance arrive trained use got nitazene testing strips keep safe fentanyl could n't look eyes anymore best friend n't .. right different person right fought argued usage dragging using drugs often getting trouble promised 'd move moved stopped talking except occasional argument n't online several days worried got phone call police day tell 'd passed away found days later apparently oxycodone 'd tested nitazenes taken anyway n't know 'm want posting thought guys would understand yk idk n't use alone naloxone could saved someone else wjth inject
Allergic reaction to codeine,"Hi, I took 5 ancient Tylenol 3’s this morning, and within 30 minutes I broke out in hives and my face started swelling, itching/burning and turning bright red. I looked like I had some fucked yo plastic surgery. Some anti histamines fixed everything so… was this just some freak thing or am I allergic to codeine?

Withdrawl question,So to start off I have been taking pharma hydros(7.5mg) about 3-4 times a week for almost a year now with some small breaks here and there. My usual dose is around 30-40mg (CWE) when I want to nod and 20-30mg when I just want a buzz. Over time my tolerance hasnt seemed to go up much and I still feel them pretty good. I have taken 2-4 day breaks here and there and havent experienced really any WD symptoms aside from small cravings and boredom/moodiness. Are my doses/frequency too low to cause withdrawls?

tapentadol is great! imo,"here’s why i like tap …

1. tapentadol has a nice euphoria that you can build on if you want.
2. in my opinion, i get WAY less itching using tapentadol. some people like the ""itch,"" but i can't stand it.
3. THE COST! i switched to tapentadol because oxy was/is way too expensive. i heard people comparing 100 mgs of tapentadol to 20 mgs of oxy so i tried it out. $150 to $200 for 100 tapentadol tablets (100 mgs each)? COUNT ME IN!
4. safety... i haven't seen anyone (at least not yet) attempt to sell ""fake"" or pressed versions of tapentadol. it comes in pharmaceutical packaging too (blister packs).
5. all of my orders have made it to my place safely without any issues. secure packaging & never any trouble with customs.
6. tapentadol genuinely makes my mental & physical health so much better. i am able to go about my day & actually get things done (pain relief). i'm more productive & happier tbh.

tapentadol is a 10/10 if you're trying to have a good time on a budget. i’m thankful i have access to it. i couldn't leave my bed due to my physical pain (from my disabilities) & the depression that came along with that... i got my life back!",1,3,2024-12-19 17:23:32,tapentadol great imo ’ like tap … 1. tapentadol nice euphoria build want 2. opinion get way less itching using tapentadol people like `` itch '' ca n't stand 3. cost switched tapentadol oxy was/is way expensive heard people comparing 100 mgs tapentadol 20 mgs oxy tried 150 200 100 tapentadol tablets 100 mgs count 4. safety ... n't seen anyone least yet attempt sell `` fake '' pressed versions tapentadol comes pharmaceutical packaging blister packs 5. orders made place safely without issues secure packaging never trouble customs 6. tapentadol genuinely makes mental physical health much better able go day actually get things done pain relief 'm productive happier tbh tapentadol 10/10 're trying good time budget ’ thankful access could n't leave bed due physical pain disabilities depression came along ... got life back

Is Long Term Tolerance a Thing? ,"Is long term tolerance a thing, or does anyone have an explanation for why I wouldn't get even a little high from 60 mg (6 Norco 10s) after not taking any opioids (including kratom) for 6 months? 

6 months ago I took a total of 2 oxycodone 10s, & i think 8 narco 10s over a few days and never got high from it. I had been going through a kilo of kratom powder a month for over a year, so I thought it was cross tolerance & quit the kratom. 

Before that, it had been maybe 5ish years & I got high af from 1 or 2 Norco 10s.

Before that, it had been about 11 years & I got high af from banging heroin. 

I started smoking weed at like 13, then started pills, ice, & ghb at 14. I tried heroin at 16 & it progressed until I quit everything at 18 or 19. I never had a ""drug of choice"" & pretty much liked them all, so I would switch between binging ice, h, benzos, plus occasional psychedelics or whatever miscellaneous substance I came across (except coke). I think that kept me from getting physically addicted to anything. I've stayed up for 6 days a lot of times until the psychosis got so bad that mailboxes looked like little girls holding hands skipping in circles like they're singing ""ring around the rosie"" at night, and I would watch bricks turn into blocks of color/light and shoot off of my neighbors houses into space during the day. I've jumped out of an airplane tripping balls on acid, taken 30 4 bars in a day & woke up in a random apartment with a family I had never met. I've wrecked into a semi & totaled my car after shooting dope at 90 mph on the highway, then overdosed the next night from pills & woke up from a coma in the hospital 3 days later. I had a really bad problem & am lucky that I didn't accidentally kill somebody or myself. 

Are my opiate, dopamine, & other receptors just fried from doing so much damage to my body while my brain was developing? If so, why did the 10-20mg of hydrocodone get me really high 5 years ago, and is there anything I can do to heal my brain?

Is 2 months off suboxone after a year on it enough time to start using painkillers again maybe 2-3 times a month tops and not get withdrawals?,"So i know most people will recommend me not getting back into painkillers in the first place but i know myself and when I originally planned to get off suboxone it was so that I could take a well needed tolerance and be able to enjoy an oxy on occasion and not have to use 100+ mg to feel anything.

Pretty much I was on suboxone (4mg a day at the peak) since december of last year until october of this year. In April/may I started weaning myself off though by .5 mg every 2 weeks MAX. The last 2-3 months I was on .25-.5mg a day total which was a dose weak enough to me that I didnt feel any of the suboxone and had very little withdrawals symptoms from that point on.

I dont even have consistent access to pharma oxy anymore ive just had 6 10s laying around for when I felt like my tolerance had dropped low enough to enjoy them. Do you guys think if I take 2 each time I wanna take them (spread out 2-3 weeks per use) I wont get withdrawal symptoms? 

For context during the peak of my painkiller addiction I was doing 5+ 30mg oxys or 2-3 40mg opanas a day (snorting) for about 4 years. I have taken other extended tolerance breaks like this one in the past but have always only used suboxone for 2-3 weeks tops to get through withdrawals. This time I stayed on it for almost an entire year. Previous times I would say about after the 40-45 day mark I was able to take 20-30 mg of painkillers and be nodding. What do you guys think?

Also I am asking strictly for the physical withdrawal side, I am aware of how hard it can be mentally when getting back into an old drug.

Why the Tramadol hate? It worked for me as someone who does 600mg Oxy a day.,"I get 270 Oxy 10’s a month scripted. When I run out earlier than I should, I take Tramadol to avoid withdrawal and I’m fine. 

Actually even though I don’t get that heavy high, I get that good feeling. I am positive, I am productive as opposed to the Oxy when I am just high and sleeping/nodding almost a day. 

I prefer Hydros, I can take 100mg of Hydro and feel great, but 200mg of Oxy? I barely feel it. 

When I take Tramadol I take 400mg in the morning with 1mg of Klonopin. I am good all day. I have this energetic happy feeling not a high. And for sleep I take 1mg of Klonopin and some Cyprexa 5mg. Wake up and repeat again.

When I stop the Tramadol for the Oxy yes it sucks. I feel all shakey, sick, and just gross. The first couple of days I can’t enjoy the Oxy high, because of the way I feel for stopping the Tramadol.

Again I only take the Tramadol to avoid WD’s. 

I have 105 pills left until refill the 14th for the Oxy. I will be talking to my doctor to put me on Hydrocodone and perhaps some Oxy for breakthrough pain. 

But, I plan to take 300mg of Tramadol for the next 10 days, so I won’t run out of Oxy. Because I genuinely feel good on Tramadol, not high just happy and positive. 

I am supposed to be on SSRI’s but I don’t take them. I also don’t want to take too much tram because of how shaky I get when I stop, since I buy these over the counter at a Mexican market here, I plan to taper the Trams. Give myself a tolly break. 

Am I weird for this? Again, I take 400mg of Tram a day with 1mg or 2 of Klonopin and another 1mg of Klonopin at night. But I plan to only take 300mg from now on and taper. I have my Oxy but I don’t want to run out especially since the Holidays are here and I don’t want to be sick around family.

COPD and insufflation ,"Recently was diagnosed with most likely COPD - pending a couple things because I’m only 34 and never been a smoker. 

I’ve been snorting various drugs as a weekend warrior for about 8 years (1-4 nights a month) and opioids in the past 6 months, but not daily, more like 2-5 days a week. 

I know when snorted, traces of drugs can end up in the lungs (even if you aren’t snorting hard - and either way, no one’s perfect every time lol) — has anyone been diagnosed with COPD secondary to their drug use or known anyone to have had this? 

I’ve always kept drugs hush hush from my Drs (aside from a couple surgeries when I was honest with the anesthesia team), so I don’t think they’re thinking drugs could be a potential reason. 

Idk, is this even a common occurrence? 

I do have a connective tissue disorder that puts me at a higher risk for these things. 

I just wanted to ask other people before I spiral off the deep end or ask a Dr, ya know? But I will bring it up eventually, when I get the balls. 

Please be kind, I’m going through a lot with this potential disease. I watched it take my grandma, a great aunt, my grandpa died of a heart attack while living with lung cancer + COPD - but they were all smokers and it’s the reason I never smoked, no vaping, rarely even weed (maybe 3x a year). 😕 It’s scary out here sometimes, fam. 

🖤 


Edit to add : incase it’s confusing, I had testing done that points to COPD. I’m being sent to a second Pulmonologist for a second review (and I’m sure more testing) since I’m only 34 and never been a smoker. However, I do have a connective tissue disorder that essentially wrecks my body and puts me at a high risk for COPD and other things. Still strange nevertheless.

Tips for Psych Portion of Withdrawal ,"Hey guys, I was put on Morphine XR everyday after a few years without methadone & constantly on opiates while I'm finishing my undergrad. I'm also on benzos usually twice a week, all script. I have insane BPD & cPTSD alot of rape & abuse shit as a child, seen too much pretty much the damage is too extent to not give benzos, opiates for the addiction & anti fentanyl protective measures.

I went from 60mg Morphine everyday to 30mg ON (OP) XR Oxy for a week, then 20, then 10, then 3-4 times a week, then less, slowly down to 60mg codeine few times a week is the goal.

After the week of 20mg I literally called in so quickly trying my hardest not to literally beg, he extended 20 for this week (till Friday) then 15, for a week, then 10, then I'm back in uni anyways so I'm chilling but, rn I haven't gone 24 hours without it since beginning of October, so I can't stop the freaking out screaming hurting myself breaking everything crying screaming sad rage and I can't cope and I'm gonna get pick up a dose of Xanax tomorrow but I'm so anxious for this shit like I can't possibly imagine going 24 hours without it rn...

sometimes I feel like the one taking the decision to blast off is not me ,"about two months ago, after my first relapse, I managed to stop taking drugs, specifically downers. 

Idk how and when I found myself again with a bottle of DHC drops. 

I thought of making a post before taking some, as if someone here would advise me not to, but I ended up convincing myself I would rather talk about how easy it is to go back to my shit-formed pleasure seeking hell of a decision making machine i’ve got attached to my neck. 

I guess all there is to do is enjoy, the one thing I will no longer be able to do for a few months. 

hope you’re reaching cero tolerance and/or absolute sobriety. Life it’s more memorable, less lonely and much more fulfilling that what opiates have to offer, we just haven’t had the best inputs. 

although having that opium experience input I deeply believe will make my life better in the long term, if I manage to quit. All there is to know and the newest self consciousness to explore, I look forward to that. 

now the high is starting to kick in, jazz and cigs to pass this melancholic and beautiful but not well earned night.

I then proceeded to do a shot sitting down on my bed last thing I remember and I then woke up on my floor laying down and did not remember the fall or anything it was like I came out of some darkness or void. It was super scary because I do not remember anything about blacking out and falling down. When I came to I also had this very very strange eco sound going on in my ears every time I would make a noise. I was not like a loud one either it was this real subtle weird sound that kept echoing in my ears. I honestly thought I went brain dead or deaf for a second and that is what went on I am not completely sure. Eventually I came to and sat and laid on my bed and then the sound went away and I ended up being ok. I just wonder if yall can give experience with this. I threw away the rest of my stuff I am and been in a super dark place mentally and originally got this drug to commit suicide.

7-OH (OPMS shots) or SUBOXONE for withdrawals?,"I only have enough ODSMT for 1 dose for tmr. My s0uřc has ran out and will be restocking either this Thursday or Friday.

Should I dose suboxone for a few days and save myself money, or should I buy a few OPMS 7-OH extracts to ease the withdrawal. For reference I use 400-500 mg of ODSMT daily.

SR-17018 is a miracle drug for recovery. Down from 600mg of isotonitazene a day to nothing in just three weeks with virtually no withdrawal,"This is a miracle drug. If you have such a high tolerance like me the first 3-4 days you will still experience very minor withdrawals (just anxiety, trouble sleeping, etc - zero peripheral withdrawals), but after that they disappear.

~7 days on 80mg twice a day, then down to 80mg once a day for another two weeks.

One thing I have noticed that's weird is it often takes 4 hours to kick in. Almost extremely reliably it would wear off after 12.5 hours (nearly every time). I also cannot for the life of me figure out how eating impacts it, it just seems random to me (with the exception of an entirely empty stomach -that's the worst way it works, I'd say taking it then eating might be the best, but that might be some sort of bias.

Make sure not to take too much or too little. 70-90mg seems to be the working range for me.

Does it stop cravings? Sort of. It lessens them, but they tend to show up around 7.5 hours for me (for maybe 2 hours).

Also I highly recommend NOT storing it in the freezer like others suggest. At least in a current UK-like climate. I did and it absorbed a bunch of water (I tried to seal it, but evidently even a small crack allowed it to do this), and I was seriously concerned I had damaged it. The worries about it having a short half life under ambient conditions do not seem founded to me. And also remember that if you ordered it from a certain country, it has been travelling for weeks and was fine (and likely was not stored under cool conditions in that country).",26,18,2024-12-16 17:30:26,sr-17018 miracle drug recovery 600mg isotonitazene day nothing three weeks virtually withdrawal miracle drug high tolerance like first 3-4 days still experience minor withdrawals anxiety trouble sleeping etc zero peripheral withdrawals disappear ~7 days 80mg twice day 80mg day another two weeks one thing noticed 's weird often takes 4 hours kick almost extremely reliably would wear 12.5 hours nearly every time also life figure eating impacts seems random exception entirely empty stomach -that 's worst way works 'd say taking eating might best might sort bias make sure take much little 70-90mg seems working range stop cravings sort lessens tend show around 7.5 hours maybe 2 hours also highly recommend storing freezer like others suggest least current uk-like climate absorbed bunch water tried seal evidently even small crack allowed seriously concerned damaged worries short half life ambient conditions seem founded also remember ordered certain country travelling weeks fine likely stored cool conditions country
"Hard to describe weird involuntary suckling, or clicking movements with my tongue on opiates ","
Hey everyone,

I have a weird question that I have been trying to figure out for some time with no luck.  Maybe you guys know of this or have experienced it.
So I am a recreational oxycodone user.  As in, I have a friend that has a prescription and she will give me like 10, 10mg pills like once a month or every other month so I am not a daily user. Anyway for about 4 years now when I take a higher dose…80 to 100mg I get this very strange suckling of my tongue when I sleep.  My tongue gets in this weird position in my mouth and I just kind of suckles and that is almost the only word I can use to describe it.  It almost sounds like a dog licking his balls lol.  If it is bad enough sometimes it wakes my wife up and if I am doing it hard enough it wakes me up too.  I am very aware that my tongue feels different but not swollen or anything like that.  When I am not on opiates I can NOT get my tongue in the suckle position and replicate the sound and feeling.  This ONLY happen when I take opiates and it has also happened a few times on higher doses of Kratom.  It is a very distinct feeling and always stops as I come down from the medicine.
Please tell me somebody has experienced this or know of anyone that has.  I want to know what it is about opiates that triggers this and if it possibly is a documented thing.  

Please help!!!!!!!",4,3,2024-12-17 03:21:48,hard describe weird involuntary suckling clicking movements tongue opiates hey everyone weird question trying figure time luck maybe guys know experienced recreational oxycodone user friend prescription give like 10 10mg pills like month every month daily user anyway 4 years take higher dose…80 100mg get strange suckling tongue sleep tongue gets weird position mouth kind suckles almost word use describe almost sounds like dog licking balls lol bad enough sometimes wakes wife hard enough wakes aware tongue feels different swollen anything like opiates get tongue suckle position replicate sound feeling happen take opiates also happened times higher doses kratom distinct feeling always stops come medicine please tell somebody experienced know anyone want know opiates triggers possibly documented thing please help
Rehab,This is my first post on Reddit and with this community. I had nearly a year clean off opiates (6 days before my 1 year) until my life in sobriety became too much. I gave up and used again and I have been ever since. I started using when I was 17 and I’m 25 now. I’ve been repeating this cycle over and over and over again. All my money is gone that I’ve saved up. Im waking up sick and feeling like shit everyday. I’m in so much debt. I’m barely keeping it together around my family. It’s the holiday season and the last thing they need is to find out that I relapsed again and I’m back in rehab. Idk what to do. I’ve been to rehab 5 different times. Should I just go as long as I can or go back to rehab. I can’t believe this has happened again. I just need some help and suggestions on what I should do.

Fell into the 7-oh trap. Oh no.,"I’m a pretty well seasoned junkie, shot speedballs on and off for 20 years. Had about 6 years clean from opiates until about a year ago, used moderately for a few months then stopped again in March. For no other reason than boredom and curiosity, started messing with the 7-oh tablets about two weeks ago and have eating 7 mg a day every day (occasionally 14 mg). I wake up with very mild wd symptoms, mostly some nausea and anxiety, but haven’t let myself start to kick because this shit is so easy to get. I’m still getting a nice little buzz when I take it, but I know I have to stop and not let this go any further. Given the amounts I’ve been taking and the length of time I’ve been taking it (a little over 2 weeks), am I in for a rough go of it? I’m mostly worried about the inevitable anxiety and depression, but not much I can do to stave that off. Hoping I can stick with the stopping, at least for a few weeks.

Protonitazene,"Hello! I have been a fentanyl user on and off since 2018. I got a bit over a year sober at one point, then had 3-8 month periods of use scattered throughout that time, about 2 or 3 times. My current run has been ongoing for about 15 months of daily usage. I use anywhere between 2g-5g+ a day (honestly, I could go more than that if I pleased... but I am always as safe as I can be... at least as safe as you can be when using fentanyl, as I’ve only OD’d once, and that was my very first use of rock product. On top of it being my first time using ""raw,"" I was also 6 months sober at the time, so my tolerance was basically non-existent. Prior to this, I had only used dirty 30s). I smoke it off foil and dab it as well. I am in the Los Angeles area, so I know dope has taken a turn for the worse when it comes to purity. It’s basically impossible to find good dope, or anything that resembles 2019-2021 dope. I’ve found a guy who has what I find to be the closest thing to it, and I find it potent and enjoyable, but due to him being damn near the only person who has good shit (and in an area that is an open-air drug market with a plethora of dope, dealers, and users to compete with, backing up my claims), I’m also paying a good bit extra for the quality (I usually get 6-7 grams for $300 USD).

On to the point of the post, though. I have recently found a vendor online who has Protonitazene at fairly good prices, and it’s said to be pretty damn pure. I am aware that this shit is extremely lethal and dangerous, that it’s more potent than fentanyl by 2x or more, and could kill someone using it whether they’re being reckless or not. I am not here to have anyone talk me out of buying it (though I’m still willing to listen to any war stories or experiences you may have heard or had with the substance... but this is not the main reason I’ve made this post). I was curious about others' experiences with the substance, how they dosed it according to their existing tolerance to opiates. I was also curious about people’s opinions on the high, and anything else you might think of when it comes to the substance.

Again, please don't comment just trying to talk me out of it. If you have a story or experience to go along with your “don’t do it, you’ll die” comment, that’s okay... but again, I am not trying to just get dry comments talking me out of it without personal experiences with the substance (whether it be by you or someone close to you). Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope I don’t come off as an asshole or pretentious. I am just curious about the drug and want to know more so I can be safe and make my OWN decision on whether or not I am going to order it. To me, I’ve heard people who use as much fentanyl as I do have dosed at 2 AM and not needed/thought about dosing again until 10-11 PM that night. That would save a ton of money... Plus, I’ve read it was the best experience they’ve had with opiates altogether, with the best high. It sounds like a win-win situation to me (other than the danger aspect, but remember, I’m a veteran opiate user and already on a very high usage of fentanyl right now, and have been for a while).",2,3,2024-12-16 23:26:23,protonitazene hello fentanyl user since 2018. got bit year sober one point 3-8 month periods use scattered throughout time 2 3 times current run ongoing 15 months daily usage use anywhere 2g-5g+ day honestly could go pleased ... always safe ... least safe using fentanyl ’ od ’ first use rock product top first time using `` raw '' also 6 months sober time tolerance basically non-existent prior used dirty 30s smoke foil dab well los angeles area know dope taken turn worse comes purity ’ basically impossible find good dope anything resembles 2019-2021 dope ’ found guy find closest thing find potent enjoyable due damn near person good shit area open-air drug market plethora dope dealers users compete backing claims ’ also paying good bit extra quality usually get 6-7 grams 300 usd point post though recently found vendor online protonitazene fairly good prices ’ said pretty damn pure aware shit extremely lethal dangerous ’ potent fentanyl 2x could kill someone using whether ’ reckless anyone talk buying though ’ still willing listen war stories experiences may heard substance ... main reason ’ made post curious others experiences substance dosed according existing tolerance opiates also curious people ’ opinions high anything else might think comes substance please n't comment trying talk story experience go along “ ’ ’ die ” comment ’ okay ... trying get dry comments talking without personal experiences substance whether someone close thank taking time read hope ’ come asshole pretentious curious drug want know safe make decision whether going order ’ heard people use much fentanyl dosed 2 needed/thought dosing 10-11 pm night would save ton money ... plus ’ read best experience ’ opiates altogether best high sounds like win-win situation danger aspect remember ’ veteran opiate user already high usage fentanyl right

God is Laughing ,"So I'm on subs & been opiate free for almost 4 years, not totally ""sober"" but managing well, the worst thing I do is gabapentin/lyrica which I unfortunately did become dependent on. Because of this I was asking my gab guy for Soma's, he has diabetes & also sells percs, which are pricey asl & I have no interest in anyway. 
Well he tells me yeah he can get me a couple Soma's for a kinda high price but whatever, at the time I didn't have enough to order online & had been looking forever. 
Well I finally get there & hes supposed to have 3 but he hands me 3 Bars LOL not the best price for those either but IDRK prices lately, I tell him it's not what & he's like 'oh right the soma I only got two of them'

And guess what he hands me???

Not soma

But 2 Dilaudid 8mg!!!!! It was a decent price for those IMO. I had to sit & think for a long ass minute😂 literally I had always regretted one thing only, that I'd never felt the incredible rush of Dilaudid, I'd only ever had it before my IV days. I always said if I could try IV Dilaudid Id do it even if I had long-term recovery. 

But of course, not only do I have 3 people who I absolutely CANNOT let down even for a second, but my Suboxone would make it almost impossible to feel, it'd be a waste of money, time, needles & veins lmao. 

So I declined the best deal I've seen for opiates since I got gs of BTH in the East Coast for less than the standard price of .3 in that area lmao.

God, or whoever the sick fuck that made this reality is, was testing me & LAUGHING🤣

don’t ever do deliriants: trip story on 750mg of benadryl,"i dont remeber much from this experience, bits of this will be from what my friend saw me doing. i took about 15 or 20 pills, 20 minutes go by and i order some food, im guessing another 30 minutes go by before it gets there, the delivery man had spiders coming out of his hair, he is missing a face, just eyes. there is also a shadow figure behind him. i grab my food and go back downstairs, later i realized i didn't even grab the food, while its true i ordered food. when i got up off the couch i just stood there, my friend had to get the food. while im trying to eat, i noticed there was a rat in my burger and my fries were snakes. i try to grab the rat and throw it, but it didn't die, my body feels like it weighs a ton. so i start throwing the snake-fries at it thinking the snakes will eat it. i'm guessing a hour goes by, i don't know how or why i got up nor do i remember. but my mom was calling me. i go upstairs and there she is, but something is off, her facial expression is her crying. but there is no noise, she tells me to follow her, i notice spiders are crawling out of her shirt. she tells me to look around and follow her. there are about 100 shadow figures behind me. she took me outside, we have a tree in our yard and she takes me there. the tree is covered in spiders, snakes, rats, i see a shadow figure with a hat and red eyes, this was when i really started to freak out, apparently to my friend, i just stood and stared at a tree for about 30 minutes. i start running away, the shadow figures chasing me, my vision went blurry, everything appeared darker, more scary in a way. i don't remeber what happend in between this, but my friend said it took me 10 minutes to supposedly ""run"" 50 feet back to the house. i get inside, my mom is at the doorway, she is unrecognizable. i started ""crying"", but once again. i was just standing right by the front door, i wanted to say ""i'm sorry, i'll be okay mom"" but my mouth was too dry. i look around and there is shadow faces with flies coming out of them, i start to panic thinking im gonna die, the flies hurt, i dont understand how i was able to feel the pain and even if it was real. i'm guessing another 2 hours go by, i don't remember inbetween it, the hallucinations are still very real to me, every minute feels like a hour, a shadow figure takes me

"is it antisocial or in bad taste to not interact with girls who try to get your attention at rave while tripping solo w/ shades, earplugs?","I always go solo these days, late 20s M and will be tripping somewhat hard + trees + a drink or two so im generally quite out of it while doing my own dance and trying to create my own vibe in my head. To avoid anxiety and to try to make sure I can stay in my space while there are groups all around me, some dancing, some chatting, etc., I made sure to wear sunglasses and earplugs for the hearing protection plus more in my own bubble. 

It always goes down like this being different girls will come and go trying to play a game to see if I take any action maybe bumping into me, standing right in front of me, might look directly at me with a glance, etc. Im also not really in the headspace to currently flirt or make moves at these shows. 

Anyways last night there was this group of girls near me and one girl also with shades on and I were both smiling cause the DJ was putting on some remixes of classic pop songs into this epic house / trance version. Lots of people were singing the lyrics and it was a very amazing moment. We both smiled at each other then she gave me like a side hug which caught me a bit off guard how quickly it happened. I was sort of laughing in my own head about it and didn't say anything, just smiled back. She was singing the lyrics at a certain point and looked right at me which went something like ""you can have anything you want"" and I was like ok so she wants me to talk to her or dance with her probably. But yeah I just smiled and went back into my dancing but felt like I should either dose MUCH less or try to be more social again cause this is happening at every show now.

best high of my fucking life,"i just finished a gram i know that’s not so much but my tolerance is low but it was fucking incredible i drank i did lines i smoked cigs and ive never felt fucking better which is why i wanna stop. my heart goes out to everyone with addiction because i feel like i understand it way more than i used to. cokes the devil and i can very clearly see how it would eat me up. i did it the first time partly just because i wanted to understand and relate and know how it feels. 

i hope everyone here’s doing okay im here to talk might not be the best but ill try, stay safe everyone keep using this subreddit for harm reduction this place has saved me from overdosing on the paracetamol in cocodamol. gonna feel awful tomorrow morning for nothing left but im gonna sleep it off weighted blankets are awesome for comedowns. 

have fun doing whatever you’re doing, drugs are everywhere people are gonna fucking do them so we need to know how to stay safe. but obviously i’d never encourage drug use my friends don’t really smoke weed let alone blow and i’d never offer them or let them if they asked because i get it man you know you’d see references in films when you were younger but you never truly got it and you never could unless you experience it, and now i have and i wanna go back but feeling like this is something else. every new song feels fucking awesome, which is again why i’m gonna stop. because it’s too good. 

this is sort of random but i watched breaking bad about a year and a half back and anytime i saw them take drugs i just didn’t understand. but now i do. i’ve thought about putting a needle into my arm and doing iv cocaine cause every story i here sounds like exactly what i want. 

my mate said i have an addictive personality and i get that now. please stay safe everyone i dont encourage using drugs, i mean enhancing good times in a social context is cool if you know the risks and are comfortable but when it becomes a crutch it gets so lonely. yk how people say weeds a gateway drug it’s sort of stupid but at the same time makes sense i mean my dealer does weed or coke so i just saw the second one and got that shit and know i have to fight awful cravings every day, and i know so many people have it so much worse. i dont wish addiction on anyone but i wanted to find people who get it.

my first coke comedown was the loneliest ive ever felt in my life. i didnt eat for three days, and i felt awful. but of course it felt good thats why i did it that’s why everyone does drugs (i mean unless you get prescribed oxy after some surgery but then you realise it feels good and you get addicted and im not addicted to opioids but ive done them and if i could’ve gotten a hold of more i fucking would’ve have because fucking hell). 

i know this guy i normally ask questions about drugs to because he had a good amount of experience and knowledge and i told him about the painkillers and he just said please be careful man it’ll destroy your life. and yeah you can do everything in moderation but that’s really hard, i mean i don’t know for everyone but at least for everyone. im coming down right now i just wanted to say everything on my mind sorry if i repeated myself or said something that didn’t make sense or was stupid if i remember this post ill come back and edit it. 

stay safe tonight guys, drugs are awesome but i guess harm reduction includes not having yourself rely on a substance and i have been, nicotine, cocaine and alcohol in some ways. it’s fucking tough but i just like thinking of other things, like cool shit i can spend my money on to stop me buying blow, like i want a leather jacket yk, or having meals with my friends because i actually have an appetite. 

here if you wanna talk, i don’t know everything and i haven’t been through everything but i feel like ive experienced enough and could maybe be a good listener for someone, just message me ill try message back rq, stay safe everyone. 

also just wanted to say that this subreddit can’t just be a bunch of people saying DONT DO DRUGS because that’s not the point the point is people do drugs and always will so we need to know how to not overdose or do something to cause serious harm. be careful out there, test your shit, try do it somewhere where someone else could get help for you if something bad happens. 

i love this shit so much man. addictions fucking tough and i already feel like im losing people and im not even far in. but i want help and i want to cut back. have a good night guys sorry if this post is nonsensical. i said at the start of the post i wanna stop, id never wanna stop feeling like this, but i know im gonna comedown and i know i wont eat and i know its expensive as shit and i know it’ll end up with me losing people i care about because while they’re similar to me in some ways they don’t do this so it feels like im alienating myself if that makes sense. 

i wish it wasn’t like that but i don’t at all wish they were addicted to blow, i wanna try and give them good advice and show them that it’s not all good at all, that you feel shit after, like really shit. i’ll never forget my first coke high but i’ll also never forget my first coke comedown and the loneliness. i don’t know who else feels like that but it sucks. good night guys i wanna listen to music and get some sleep.",6,54,2025-01-26 06:42:38,best high fucking life finished gram know ’ much tolerance low fucking incredible drank lines smoked cigs ive never felt fucking better wan na stop heart goes everyone addiction feel like understand way used cokes devil clearly see would eat first time partly wanted understand relate know feels hope everyone ’ okay im talk might best ill try stay safe everyone keep using subreddit harm reduction place saved overdosing paracetamol cocodamol gon na feel awful tomorrow morning nothing left im gon na sleep weighted blankets awesome comedowns fun whatever ’ drugs everywhere people gon na fucking need know stay safe obviously ’ never encourage drug use friends ’ really smoke weed let alone blow ’ never offer let asked get man know ’ see references films younger never truly got never could unless experience wan na go back feeling like something else every new song feels fucking awesome ’ gon na stop ’ good sort random watched breaking bad year half back anytime saw take drugs ’ understand ’ thought putting needle arm iv cocaine cause every story sounds like exactly want mate said addictive personality get please stay safe everyone dont encourage using drugs mean enhancing good times social context cool know risks comfortable becomes crutch gets lonely yk people say weeds gateway drug ’ sort stupid time makes sense mean dealer weed coke saw second one got shit know fight awful cravings every day know many people much worse dont wish addiction anyone wanted find people get first coke comedown loneliest ive ever felt life didnt eat three days felt awful course felt good thats ’ everyone drugs mean unless get prescribed oxy surgery realise feels good get addicted im addicted opioids ive done could ’ gotten hold fucking would ’ fucking hell know guy normally ask questions drugs good amount experience knowledge told painkillers said please careful man ’ destroy life yeah everything moderation ’ really hard mean ’ know everyone least everyone im coming right wanted say everything mind sorry repeated said something ’ make sense stupid remember post ill come back edit stay safe tonight guys drugs awesome guess harm reduction includes rely substance nicotine cocaine alcohol ways ’ fucking tough like thinking things like cool shit spend money stop buying blow like want leather jacket yk meals friends actually appetite wan na talk ’ know everything ’ everything feel like ive experienced enough could maybe good listener someone message ill try message back rq stay safe everyone also wanted say subreddit ’ bunch people saying dont drugs ’ point point people drugs always need know overdose something cause serious harm careful test shit try somewhere someone else could get help something bad happens love shit much man addictions fucking tough already feel like im losing people im even far want help want cut back good night guys sorry post nonsensical said start post wan na stop id never wan na stop feeling like know im gon na comedown know wont eat know expensive shit know ’ end losing people care ’ similar ways ’ feels like im alienating makes sense wish ’ like ’ wish addicted blow wan na try give good advice show ’ good feel shit like really shit ’ never forget first coke high ’ also never forget first coke comedown loneliness ’ know else feels like sucks good night guys wan na listen music get sleep
Anyone know how to maximize alkaloid content in grown poppies?,"A lot of plants you can grow in specific ways to make them have more fun substances in them. For peppers, if you let them dry out quite a bit regularly once the fruits start growing, they supposedly get a lot hotter. With tomatoes, watering less and more steadily makes them taste better.

benzo and stim mixing with sober delussions,"

What the fuck is up with mixing those benzos and RCs or stimulants together, for example, such as bromazolam or whatever? I mean, seriously, what’s the appeal? Is it just the rush? The escape? Or the way it dulls everything that feels too sharp to handle? I don’t know if it’s just me overthinking this stuff or if this is a bigger issue, but I feel like my whole perspective on drug usage and addiction has completely shifted since I started messing with this.



I’ve been on it for a week now, and honestly, it’s been enough to shake me to my core. I’m scared. I mean, what are the signs that you’re really getting high—not just recreationally, but like addicted? When does it go from “just trying something out” to full-on dependence? With benzos, it’s such a thin line, and I think I’m starting to see that. It’s weird because I feel numb, like everything around me has lost its edge, and even stuff I usually care about, like sex or just human connection, doesn’t feel important anymore. It’s like these drugs have stripped away some fundamental part of who I am or what I want.



What really terrifies me is what happens next. What are the withdrawal signs? What’s going to happen if I stop now? Will it be painful, or will it just be uncomfortable? I’ve read about the anxiety, the shaking, the sleepless nights—but what if it’s worse than that? What if stopping this early isn’t enough to reverse what’s already started? I keep wondering when it’s “too late” to go back, you know? Like, is there a point where you’ve gone so far down the rabbit hole that there’s no way out? I don’t want that to be me. But then I think, is it already too late? Or is a week not long enough for it to grab hold of me completely?



This experience has completely changed the way I think about addiction. I always thought it was something that happened to other people, people who made different choices, or people who didn’t know how to stop themselves. But now, I see how easy it is to fall into this trap. It’s not just about getting high; it’s about how the drugs creep into every corner of your life, dulling your emotions, your desires, your ambitions, and even your fears—until all you’re left with is the cycle of using and chasing.



I think I should stop. No, I *know* I should stop. But there’s a strange part of me that’s curious—curious about what’s happening to me, curious about what others have gone through. I’d definitely stop, but I just want to understand. Have you ever dealt with something like this? What are your experiences with it? How do you know when it’s time to quit and never look back? If you’ve been in this kind of situation or seen someone else go through it, what advice would you give? I’m desperate to hear how others have navigated this because I don’t want to be stuck in this spiral.",1,0,2025-01-26 14:53:13,benzo stim mixing sober delussions fuck mixing benzos rcs stimulants together example bromazolam whatever mean seriously ’ appeal rush escape way dulls everything feels sharp handle ’ know ’ overthinking stuff bigger issue feel like whole perspective drug usage addiction completely shifted since started messing ’ week honestly ’ enough shake core ’ scared mean signs ’ really getting high—not recreationally like addicted go “ trying something ” full-on dependence benzos ’ thin line think ’ starting see ’ weird feel numb like everything around lost edge even stuff usually care like sex human connection ’ feel important anymore ’ like drugs stripped away fundamental part want really terrifies happens next withdrawal signs ’ going happen stop painful uncomfortable ’ read anxiety shaking sleepless nights—but ’ worse stopping early ’ enough reverse ’ already started keep wondering ’ “ late ” go back know like point ’ gone far rabbit hole ’ way ’ want think already late week long enough grab hold completely experience completely changed way think addiction always thought something happened people people made different choices people ’ know stop see easy fall trap ’ getting high ’ drugs creep every corner life dulling emotions desires ambitions even fears—until ’ left cycle using chasing think stop know stop ’ strange part ’ curious—curious ’ happening curious others gone ’ definitely stop want understand ever dealt something like experiences know ’ time quit never look back ’ kind situation seen someone else go advice would give ’ desperate hear others navigated ’ want stuck spiral
Are my serotonin receptors not responding?,"Hi,
I’ve been taking antidepressants for about a year and a half.
During the first half of this period, I was on Lexapro (it worked well for the first few months, but then it stopped being effective).
Afterward, I switched to Trintellix, but it didn’t work for me either.

Could it be that antidepressants don’t work for me because I occasionally used drugs while on treatment? (I occasionally used cocaine, MDMA once, and drank alcohol every weekend.)

I’m currently struggling with:
	•	Derealization (feeling like nothing around me is real).
	•	OCD.
	•	Visual disconnection (feeling like my vision isn’t “real” or clear).
	•	Poor memory and concentration.
	•	Emotional numbness.
	•	Extreme apathy.

Is it possible that I’ve damaged my brain and my serotonin receptors no longer respond to antidepressants?

I’m really worried about the things I did in the past. I can’t stop thinking that I ruined my life and will never be the same as I was before. However, I wonder if this is just a symptom of my OCD and retrospective bias.

I know I can’t change the past, but these thoughts keep haunting me. Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.",2,1,2025-01-26 11:00:57,serotonin receptors responding hi ’ taking antidepressants year half first half period lexapro worked well first months stopped effective afterward switched trintellix ’ work either could antidepressants ’ work occasionally used drugs treatment occasionally used cocaine mdma drank alcohol every weekend ’ currently struggling • derealization feeling like nothing around real • ocd • visual disconnection feeling like vision ’ “ real ” clear • poor memory concentration • emotional numbness • extreme apathy possible ’ damaged brain serotonin receptors longer respond antidepressants ’ really worried things past ’ stop thinking ruined life never however wonder symptom ocd retrospective bias know ’ change past thoughts keep haunting advice similar experiences would greatly appreciated

"Marquis, Simon’s and Froehde MDMA Reagents","So I purchased the MDMA test kit from a reputable website and I had two different pressings (a yellow DK and a blue pill with a dolphin) that I tested.

The most helpful harm reduction app I've ever used,"Long post ahead !

This is not a sponsor or promotion haha but I use this app called ""psychonautwiki journal"". It's available for free on ios and I believe android as well but I'm unsure. You do not need to make an account and it does not collect any data about you.

This app allows you to log your substance ingestions, the amounts, the time you took them, how full your stomach was upon ingestion, who took the substance, and more. It will show you the timeline of your high, from ingestion, to comeup, plateaus, and comedowns. It also takes into account how full your stomach is and adjusts the timeline accordingly. You can also select the type of intake, such as oral, sublingual, intravenously, and more.

It has a MASSIVE amount of substances to log, including many niche research chemicals. Most (if not all) of the substances you can read about within the app, including what doses are threshold, light, common, and heavy. It also provides information about dangerous combinations when you log them. There is an entire section within the app called ""safer"", which includes many resources and lots of information about substances, dosing, testing, and even allergies. 

It will save each of your logged ingestions like a journals. You can see your stats including current tolerances, total amounts taken over different periods of times, and a list of every substance you've logged. You can also select a color for the graph of each substance! 

I could rant about this app for a while because there are many features but I HIGHLY recommend you download it and familiarize yourself. I felt a little confused about it at first so this is how I'd go about familiarizing yourself: check out the substances tab at the bottom of the app and search for a few you know about, open them and read about the kind of info the app gives. Next to the search bar, there's a filter option, there you can view just how many substances this app includes. Then I would go to the journal tab and log a new substance just to see the process and see what the graph looks like. Then I would check out the settings tab because there were a ton of customizable settings I didn't know about that made the app easier for me to understand personally.

Anyway, as you can tell I really recommend this app as it has helped me in so many situations, especially when information is not very readily available on google. Please check it out if you'd like! I use it every day and it's helped me gain a much better understanding of different drugs and safety and also how much I'm actually using and not paying attention to.

Been Debating Internally All Week…Feel Like It’s Time 4 A Break ❄️,"I don’t know if this happens to everyone who uses substances frequently; my DOC is coke but lately it’s just not doing it for me. Its not even about the quality. No issues there. I tried the route of buying more to see if that would help but that didnt work either.

My dealer told me stop altogether or take an extended break because at this point I’m just wasting money. He mentioned that to me early last week and it’s true I pretty much been wasting money but now I’m realizing it and feel stupid lol.

It could be just time to stop, give my body a break, my wallet a break, and deal with whatever issues I have another way. Mainly it’s really just the wasting of the money lollll. In this economy I refuse. Sorry for the long post, sometimes when you write shit out it’s easier to see if your thoughts make sense or not.

I was Butters Stotch for a Moment.,"Hey everyone, I got some green from a good friend and wanted to roll a joint to relax.

Once I was done, I sat on the balcony and took **three puffs** before I had to put it out.

After the first puff, my heart started racing more than usual, and after the second puff, it felt like my feet were full of blood and three times thicker. By the third and final puff, *everything went wild*;

**I thought I was on a movie set, and when I went into my room and looked in the mirror, I thought I was Butters Stotch from the show South Park. I couldn't shake that thought for about 20 minutes and even considered self-harm.**

In my 9 years of using cannabis, I had never experienced anything like this, and now everything is fine, but I'm really curious about what just happened.

I don't know want to double up, just take one in the morning than another in the arvo. Would the later one need to be stronger? Or would I have a bit of tolerance and it not be worth it.

Holy shit I understand why people become fentanyl addicts,"So I had a small surgery today and was administered rohypnol and fentanyl during the procedure. Holy smokes, that stuff was ridiculously nice. Funnily enough, one of the patients next to me after the surgery was forgetting to breathe all the time because of the painkillers they were administered (don't know if it was fentanyl or morphine), which was kind of hilarious. The beeping machine thingy was always going off, so the nurses repeatedly  came to the patient and yelled ""REMEMBER TO BREATHE"" and the patient was like ""oh right, yeah okay"".  But yeah, anyways, holy shit fentanyl was scary nice. My heart goes out to all fentanyl addicts.

i just wanna talk so much,"all i wanna do on blow is just talk, breaks my heart when people go to bed or go home i just have so much to say while skiing. but normally i struggle to find words or things to say when im sober i don’t get where all these extra words come from. like i don’t like that part of me that i can’t talk to people well and i can’t find things to say or feeling like im boring i just want human connection yk. 

i wanna explanation but i also just wanna talk. i feel like a different person on cocaine and i like who i am then but i dont like this i will inevitably come down and feel like absolute crapand then be craving it for weeks and weeks, especially when i drink i just want a bag. 

i heard that physical withdrawals from coke arent really a thing (correct me if im wrong) but the fucking psychological pull of it is only something you can understand if you do it or something along the same vein. 

i didn’t for just over three weeks and i got pissed today with friends and it was all i could think about. and planning the day i was thinking how i could fit in picking up a bag. and i didn’t like that. because no one i know does this or gets it i mean i feel like ill push people away if i keep doing coke but most seem to be really empathetic. 

one reason i started doing coke in the first place was because i wanted to understand. understand how good it feels and understand addiction and why people do it. 

i know every dealer cuts their coke with different amounts of different shit so the purity and the high is hit or miss but i know mines fucking good and that pull of it is something i wanna forget or at least subside, because i don’t know if i can go the rest of my life without this but maybe if i just keep if for certain environments to like make good moments better because ive had trouble yk and i know everyone’s been through something bad but at a certain point i just suddenly felt like i wanted to just forget or feel different. 

so my first experience with that was codeine, pretty weak opioid, but felt so warm and cozy yk, and if i could’ve got more i would’ve. i don’t wanna make people take drugs i just know they will and people take them because they feel good but obviously there’s crap downsides. opioids are addictive as shit, and for a while i just smoke a bit of weed after that, but i got a dealer with coke and i scored. had a low ass tolerance, didn’t get much, but i’ll never forget that high. 

but the comedown too i’ll never forget. i’m saying so much sorry. it’s getting light out i hate that it’s the worst part of stims. but yeah basically i was just wondering why me and so many people are so talkative on cocaine like i said i could talk for days which is a complete switch up from my normal self. sorry for taking so much.",1,3,2025-01-26 07:40:36,wan na talk much wan na blow talk breaks heart people go bed go home much say skiing normally struggle find words things say im sober ’ get extra words come like ’ like part ’ talk people well ’ find things say feeling like im boring want human connection yk wan na explanation also wan na talk feel like different person cocaine like dont like inevitably come feel like absolute crapand craving weeks weeks especially drink want bag heard physical withdrawals coke arent really thing correct im wrong fucking psychological pull something understand something along vein ’ three weeks got pissed today friends could think planning day thinking could fit picking bag ’ like one know gets mean feel like ill push people away keep coke seem really empathetic one reason started coke first place wanted understand understand good feels understand addiction people know every dealer cuts coke different amounts different shit purity high hit miss know mines fucking good pull something wan na forget least subside ’ know go rest life without maybe keep certain environments like make good moments better ive trouble yk know everyone ’ something bad certain point suddenly felt like wanted forget feel different first experience codeine pretty weak opioid felt warm cozy yk could ’ got would ’ ’ wan na make people take drugs know people take feel good obviously ’ crap downsides opioids addictive shit smoke bit weed got dealer coke scored low ass tolerance ’ get much ’ never forget high comedown ’ never forget ’ saying much sorry ’ getting light hate ’ worst part stims yeah basically wondering many people talkative cocaine like said could talk days complete switch normal self sorry taking much

"Nac, omeprazole, Benadryl, Tagamet, potentiate","I use oxycodone mainly I get a lot of percs. Naturally they come with apap which is complete ass. I don’t really have a safe space to do. 

The whole cwe extract process. Anyways this last script I decided to try these for some potentiate. I would usually take the nac once a day for apap safety. The rest I would take a pill of each two or three times a day. I noticed it actually made it incredibly hard to get to nodding territory. I thought it was just my tolerance. The second to last day of my binge. I said fuck it and didn’t want to potentiate. Holy shit I nodded off like half the amount. I instantly got sick as hell though. I don’t know if my nod was from me getting sick or what very confused on that part. 

I feel like taking this plethora of drugs on top of the oxy. Made my high feel even more clean than usual. I had incredible euphoria but less sedative. I feel like It kept my head on straighter. Not as much slurring my words or zoning out at work. Which actually made it pretty nice. I don’t know which one helped so much with nausea. Usually since I’m taking so much apap. I get very nauseous if I over do it that day or go too many days. Without taking a break for my liver. This was an added plus, I think it was either the nac or Benadryl. That mainly helped with that. I would say taking these was about 6’s. I don’t feel like it made my high stronger or last longer. I feel like it just made it feel a lot less sedative and more head rush. I didn’t get nearly as sick or dumbed out though.

If anyone else has experience taking any of these drugs with oxy. Please let me know. I want to kinda fine tune the process. Maybe get it so I still nod as often without puking. Maybe figuring out what made me nod less and take that during the day. Then at night lay off it so I can nod hard. 

For anyone just wondering about using nac for helping with apap. I feel like it made a major difference. Everyday I took the nac in the morning. I felt like I wasn’t killing my liver and getting ulcers. I would 100% recommend using it to help with apap.",1,1,2025-01-26 07:32:20,nac omeprazole benadryl tagamet potentiate use oxycodone mainly get lot percs naturally come apap complete ass ’ really safe space whole cwe extract process anyways last script decided try potentiate would usually take nac day apap safety rest would take pill two three times day noticed actually made incredibly hard get nodding territory thought tolerance second last day binge said fuck ’ want potentiate holy shit nodded like half amount instantly got sick hell though ’ know nod getting sick confused part feel like taking plethora drugs top oxy made high feel even clean usual incredible euphoria less sedative feel like kept head straighter much slurring words zoning work actually made pretty nice ’ know one helped much nausea usually since ’ taking much apap get nauseous day go many days without taking break liver added plus think either nac benadryl mainly helped would say taking 6 ’ ’ feel like made high stronger last longer feel like made feel lot less sedative head rush ’ get nearly sick dumbed though anyone else experience taking drugs oxy please let know want kinda fine tune process maybe get still nod often without puking maybe figuring made nod less take day night lay nod hard anyone wondering using nac helping apap feel like made major difference everyday took nac morning felt like ’ killing liver getting ulcers would 100 recommend using help apap
MDMA doesn’t work on me,"So basically went to my first rave and took 80mg of mdma. i didn’t feel anything at all.

I just tried again last night. 1 cap (160mg), same cap an hour later, still nothing… then i had a bag. We also had 2 bags worth about 5 pills each on us, i had half of the bag straight and the rest in water. I felt the same as the time before + little burping.

I need help finding something that works for me,"Hello

I am in search for something like Kratom, preferably a pharmaceutical. Long story short, I suffer from a moderate stutter and speech blocks, and struggle socially.

My focus at work and other activities is second to none while I’m on Kratom

Kratom completely annihilated my SA, and made me confident. It made me happy to do daunting work task, annoying situation, ETC.


I honestly never want to go back to how I was before the Kratom, but it’s too expensive and habit forming. I take extracts and 7OH daily now.

Is there another pharmaceutical that delivers the same mood boost, focus, sociability , and confidence that Kratom does???

Mom hid my prescription,"Got surgery and the doc prescribed me four 5mg hydros.  When my mom picked up the script she refused to give them to me cause I had taken an Tylenol earlier and “you could OD if you took one now.” I tried to explain to her that the 325mg acetaminophen in the hydro combined with the 500mg id taken three hours previously was not gonna make me OD but she insisted she had done her research and that 6 hours after I had taken the Tylenol she would give me my hydros. 

The 3 more hours finally passed but instead of the bottle she had promised she gave me a quarter of a pill, a fucking quarter of a 5mg hydro, these shits aren’t even meant to break into quarters idk how she did that shit even.

best way to end a crystal bender??,"my friend/roommate LOVES crystal 
he has gone on a 1 year bender before we even met, but now he’s older and seemingly falling apart
he has said for weeks that he will stop as soon as his little baggie ends… but then he goes and gets more. 

the problem is: he is in a labor intensive field and he’s very hard working 

so tomorrow - Sunday, is his day off. he has SOME crystal left that he says he’s only going to use to fight the withdrawals - he’s been using for around 2 months as of today. 

and then he has to work on monday again… seemingly without it and the perfect excuse to go get more

I have called his client on his behalf as a co-worker to tell them he came down with a heavy flu and might need at least a few days to recover. that’s so that he can get 2 days off, which he doesn’t get often 

he knows that I’ve done this and he usually doesn’t like to cancel on his clients but he understands why and even agrees that he’ll need at least 1 more day after Sunday to recover 

I am thinking the best way to withdrawal would be to cut it cold turkey on Sunday - give him lots of weed and maybe even find some xanax to help him rest, eat, rehydrate. he has never had a problem with benzos, btw. but it immediately puts an end the alcohol withdrawals - of which he has also been daily drinking - just budlights and IPA

on monday he intends to stay clean and work things with his sponsor - he is capable of staying sober for well over 4 years. 

he on the other hand seems to want to gradually diminish his intake of crystal over the course of 2 days. I’ve never been dependent on crystal but I call BS on that! it seems to be something that you either quit or don’t, right? unlike alcohol or benzos which could be dangerous - but he has not done either of those for long enough to get delirium tremens, etc. so he would be safe using benzos to cold quit 2 months of daily beer

so what’s the best way to go about it? the dopamine spikes could keep him stuck in lizard brain mode, where he ends up getting more on days he has to work or else he will be physically incapable to.

maybe two spa days of eating, rehydrating, weed and lots and lots of sleep could help a lot more in the long run?",1,5,2025-01-26 04:43:53,best way end crystal bender friend/roommate loves crystal gone 1 year bender even met ’ older seemingly falling apart said weeks stop soon little baggie ends… goes gets problem labor intensive field ’ hard working tomorrow sunday day crystal left says ’ going use fight withdrawals ’ using around 2 months today work monday again… seemingly without perfect excuse go get called client behalf co-worker tell came heavy flu might need least days recover ’ get 2 days ’ get often knows ’ done usually ’ like cancel clients understands even agrees ’ need least 1 day sunday recover thinking best way withdrawal would cut cold turkey sunday give lots weed maybe even find xanax help rest eat rehydrate never problem benzos btw immediately puts end alcohol withdrawals also daily drinking budlights ipa monday intends stay clean work things sponsor capable staying sober well 4 years hand seems want gradually diminish intake crystal course 2 days ’ never dependent crystal call bs seems something either quit ’ right unlike alcohol benzos could dangerous done either long enough get delirium tremens etc would safe using benzos cold quit 2 months daily beer ’ best way go dopamine spikes could keep stuck lizard brain mode ends getting days work else physically incapable maybe two spa days eating rehydrating weed lots lots sleep could help lot long run

Ecstasy/MDMA Immunity?,"I was at a techno event yesterday with some friends, who offered me to try ecstasy for the first time (they are pretty experienced). I had only ever smoked weed before this. When we got there I had drunk like 4 beers to that point. They gave me a little cut of a pill and then I waited. After one hour of nothing happening they gave me another cut and still nothing. After that I snorted MDMA in hopes to accelerate the effectiveness. After 5 hours of taking the first cut of the pill, I was still feeling nothing. Literally zero effect. My friends were pretty high from the pill, so it wasn’t an issue of quality. 

I did some research and apparently a reason for the ineffectiveness could be my fast metabolism. I have an insanely fast metabolism, to the point where I can literally eat McDonald’s and other junk food for five days straight and not gain a single Gramm. 

Another possible reason, although it seems far fetched, is that I am generally a very happy and care free person in my day to day life. I rarely get pissed and bummed about stuff. So could it potentially be that I already have a naturally high dopamine level, which drugs like ecstasy cannot really increase?",0,9,2025-01-26 05:43:35,ecstasy/mdma immunity techno event yesterday friends offered try ecstasy first time pretty experienced ever smoked weed got drunk like 4 beers point gave little cut pill waited one hour nothing happening gave another cut still nothing snorted mdma hopes accelerate effectiveness 5 hours taking first cut pill still feeling nothing literally zero effect friends pretty high pill ’ issue quality research apparently reason ineffectiveness could fast metabolism insanely fast metabolism point literally eat mcdonald ’ junk food five days straight gain single gramm another possible reason although seems far fetched generally happy care free person day day life rarely get pissed bummed stuff could potentially already naturally high dopamine level drugs like ecstasy really increase
hate my life gang v2 (update),"another day goes by where i find myself crying while im taking my daily lines just so i don’t go into withdrawals. especially when im at my girlfriends house, her dad nor her mom can know, and they know how withdrawal symptoms differ from the regular cold/flu.

(im 22 and she’s 20, we both live at home with parents and swap weeks at each others houses. neither in school, but both have jobs). 

i did the math the other day, i snorted about 178 dilaudid pills in approximately 2 weeks. that’s fucked bro. that adds up to about 12.7 pills a day, which in reality is 20+ some days and as little as 6 or 7 on others.

what has my life come to. i was scared of JT becoming prime minister in 2016 when i was 14 because he was gonna legalize weed, and i thought that was bad. now here i am not even 10 years later a junkie, an addict, a retard. 

i want to stop. i can’t. i stop for 30 days then relapse. have never gotten past 35 days clean in the last 3 years. i don’t wanna live like this anymore. 

my plug told me some devastating news about his supply. come March 1st they will be circulating less and less. so he’s nudging me to quit.

what is my best option for treatments? i heard methadone and subs are pretty hard to get off of as well and withdrawals scare the fuck out of me man. i don’t wanna kick one habit for the other, and then have to restart the process all over again. i have a go to plan when i need to quit in emergency situations like family vacations etc. 

it’s a 4 week process: **percocet for pain management (3-4 pills every 6 hours or so or as needed) since my tolerance to hydromorphone is quite high, this doesn’t give me any euphoria and allows for physical symptoms to ease off. then diazepam every night i have withdrawal induced insomnia**. 

this method honestly does help me quit in dyer situations as listed above, but last time i got the diazepam i folded once i mixed them with the dilaudid i had leftover. and that mix brother, that mix will be my downfall. it is so great. so amazing. anyways. 

what do you think i should do? rehab? mental clinic? subs/mdone? i hate ts bro, i wanna kick it so badly but i cant.

Comprehensive guide to relatively safe Wellbutrin insufflation,"First and foremost, let's not kid ourselves here: **This is not a good idea in general.**

**The high is lackluster, comparatively dangerous to other stimulants, and is something someone only really does either because they are extremely desperate, or extremely bored.** 

With this in mind what I hope to accomplish is a step-by-step guide to snorting Wellbutrin in a way that is less likely to cause serious side effects.

This guide is going to be specific to Bupropion Hydrochloride XL as it is what I have on hand, although I'm sure this will work with other pills containing this active ingredient as well. 

  
**Step 0:** Eat a meal beforehand, and in general keep your body healthy. This goes a long way in protecting yourself from the negatives of drug use in general. 

**Step 1 (optional but highly recommended):** Before you begin your lovely journey to being an absolute tweaker idiot like myself, I recommend administering a small to moderate amount of an anticonvulsant, usually a benzodiazepine. In my case this is a little bit of Valium about 30 minutes before I start. This will decrease the likelihood of having seizures, which is the main concern with snorting Wellbutrin. It will also go some way towards managing blood pressure and heartrate. **But very importantly, only take a small amount of this.** Too much sedative can mask the stimulant effects of the Wellbutrin and cause you to take too much in search of the stimulant high. Remember, you're just trying to avoid seizures, not get barred out. 

**Step 2:** Quarter your pills with a knife. Place the blade on top of the pill and apply pressure until it snaps in two, then do this perpendicular to the first cut. Once quartered, put the pieces into some kind of small dish or even a mortar and pestle and pulverize the quarters as best you can. I used a small metal dish and a bit of rock to do this. **Another warning, don't go over 300mg of this stuff in one session. I have never pushed the dose to see what the limit is and I don't plan to. 300mg is plenty in one sitting. If you want more, get some coke. Wellbutrin is not only a drug that promotes seizures, but also an anticholinergic (this is why it's sometimes used for smoking cessation). A good rule of thumb is that too much anticholinergic = psychosis and an awful/dangerous time. Deliriants are anticholinergic drugs, so Wellbutrin will act as a deliriant in high enough doses. You don't want this.**

  
**Step 3:** Take the resultant pulverized material and pour a small amount of room temp or cold water into it. Not a lot of water ( I ran my tap as slow as it could go and dipped my dish under it for like a third of a second). You want enough water that the pieces of the shell of the pills are able to float around but not much more. You don't want so little water that it's a paste either. Stir this for a while. Then take a syringe and pressing it to the bottom of the dish to avoid sucking up larger pieces, pull the water up and out of the dish. It doesn't matter if there's still some particulate in the syringe. If you don't have a syringe, using a fine metal filter like those found in coffee machines may work. A paper filter would probably wick away too much of the solution through capillary action to be worthwhile.

  
**Step 4:** Squirt the water onto as flat a plate as you have, you want it to spread out into a very thin layer. **The idea so far is that Bupropion HCL is very soluble in water, so there should be a lot in the water, and a good deal of the other junk in the pill is left behind (like the coating, which I've read some people try to meticulously remove by hand). We now want to get rid of the water so we have, if not pure Bupropion HCL than much closer to it than before.** Place the dish in the microwave and run it for maybe 1.5 to 2 minutes. Watch this closely. You will see the water give way to a thin white layer deposited on the plate. The moment all the water is gone, stop the microwave. As soon as the water is gone the temp will go above 100C and the Bupropion will start to vaporize. It's alright if a little bit does this, you want it to be bone dry after all, but don't let all of it turn to vapor obviously.

  
**Step 5:** Now let it cool off for a second, it will be very hot. Then take something sharp and wide and begin to scrape this white coating off the plate. I did this with a flathead screwdriver, which was meticulous because of the small area that I could scrape at a time, but it worked. You want to get as much of this white stuff off the plate as possible, this is what you're gonna snort. Once the plate is scraped to your desired level, take a card and pull everything into a line or two. We are now ready for action. Snort away. **This honestly doesn't hurt any more than speed when done this way. And although surely a lot of product is lost in this procedure, it's worth it in my opinion.** 

  
**Additional Warnings:**

**- Watch your heartrate closely.** The peripheral cardiovascular effects of doing this increase way faster than the subjective stimulant effects do. So even if you don't feel particularly high, you're heart might be going wild. And it goes without saying that if you have any preexisting cardio condition then never do this to begin with.

**-Watch for signs of psychosis/ anticholinergic effects.** The symptoms of this are listed as: **dry mouth, warm red skin, dilated pupils, hallucinations, tachycardia, diminished bowel movements, and urinary retention**. If you begin to notice anything like this while snorting Wellbutrin, stop immediately. Maybe take more sedative if possible but only if you feel you are in enough control of yourself to stay in a safe place while it passes and that the sedative won't disinhibit you to the point of doing stupid shit. 

  
This is likely the most pointless post I have ever made. But here we are. Safe travels everyone.

Did the ketamine magic ever return?,"I had a couple years where I would k hole or close to it every couple weeks. Nothing as crazy as some I read here who do it nightly but apparently it was enough to eventually lose the magic as dissociatives are known for their “permanent” tolerance. 

I actually switched to preferring the simulating 3-meo-pcp experience more which too of course contributed to my tolerance build up. The last time I did the 3meo was a couple months since the last and still 20mg hardly did much at all. 

So my question is, is there anyone that can speak to regaining the magic of these substances whether it be many months or years down the line or is it truly a matter of permanence?",1,7,2025-01-26 01:01:05,ketamine magic ever return couple years would k hole close every couple weeks nothing crazy read nightly apparently enough eventually lose magic dissociatives known “ permanent ” tolerance actually switched preferring simulating 3-meo-pcp experience course contributed tolerance build last time 3meo couple months since last still 20mg hardly much question anyone speak regaining magic substances whether many months years line truly matter permanence
Any suggestions to help with nausea from taking Percocet?,"
Every time I take Percocet (technically oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325) I do t have the highest tolerance, I usually only take anywhere from 3-4.5 pills which is about 15 mg. I puke my brains out. I also have to keep my head super still, like I can look from left to right too quickly or I get very nauseous. I’ve tried taking with a decent amount of food, small amount, and no food. No food still leaves me feeling sickies as well. Are there any tips or tricks to avoid this? It is definitely a buzz kill whenever this happens.

Methamphetamine pinning and residual effects,"Say SWIM decided that based on the last time he pinned over a year and a half ago, he didn’t want to go for the typical inner forearm rush because it really ached and felt weird for days after. Almost a mix of pleasure and pain but very truamatized and not worth the recovery

  
This SWIM happens to be pretty clever, as a potato, and thought well, let’s aim for distal body locations like hand and fingers, foot etc.

  
it was weird, and because the distance or tubes traveled were factors it burned like unholy fire, then cooked SWIM brain as it naturally does.

  
it was a decent high based on the quality but the side effects are still very similar to the acute ones in the inner arm area, just this time SWIM leg or arm zaps and bounces and he’s really hoping all he did was burn some non essential things like uhh, whatever , and not like, nerves. 

the acute areas still have numbness which is typical I guess.  But the tingles are overrated and similar in strength to beta alanine.

  
i know SWIM is an idiot, we both are, and I’ve told him this can’t happen again so we worked on a plan to move forward.

"200mgs of Vyvanse, help needed","So to start off, considering the caption, I need help. 😭 Basically, the night before last I got my hands on 5 MYLAN LE 40’s and thought hmm maybe I shouldn’t pop some of these tonight but wait till tomorrow so I can actually go to sleep. That specific night though I had already taken my prescribed medications (Buspar 5mg, 3 times daily) (Prozac 30mg daily) and 200 mgs of tramadol, plus 800mgs of pregabalin. Yes, probably very stupid of me but fuck it we ball. 

Anyways, I wake up the next day and pop 2 of these vyvanse pills, which I gave about 2 hours to work its magic. Nothing. So I begin to think, hmmm if I just took more i’ll actually feel something! So I then pop another 2. I gave it about 2 more hours after dosing. Nothing. So when 3:30pm comes around and I am about to go to work my dumbass decides to pop yet ANOTHER pill. Mind you, when I take stimulants like Adderall or Ritilan (two different drugs, I know) I enjoy around 30mgs of Adderall or 72-108mgs of Ritilan, which usually gets me to where I want to be, but I’ve never really experimented with Vyvanse  before and I knew that Vyvanse and Adderall metabolizes into the same substance, it’s just Vyvanse is weaker. Oh and I should also mention anytime I take more than 40mgs of Adderall I tend to get really weak and throw up when coming down, no clue why. 

But anyways, while I was at work I would get slight euphoria here and there with a side of tingly feelings  all over my body, but nothing crazy. I got off work early (7pm) and I start to notice that I’m shaking, like really bad, but I thought nothing of it. I came home and played xbox until like 5 in the morning because I couldn’t fall asleep and just to make things worse I had to work a 12-7 the next day. So I tried going to sleep but that was not happening, I was still shakey and now my stomach started to feel queasy (just like how it was when I took 40+ mgs of Adderall). 

I sat there in my bed for about 5 hours curled up and overthinking about what was to come. I took a shower around 11am and drank two cups of coffee to wake me up: 1 before work, and 1 on the way to work. BIG MISTAKE. I got STUPIDLY shakey again and when I arrived at work my stomach was A LOT worse than before. I thought I had to throw up so I went to the bathroom but I just had to shit. That was about an hour ago. I’m feeling not as bad as before but my stomach kinda still hurts and I’m not really shakey anymore. I tried eating last night but I was NOT getting that shit down 😭😭. On top of that, I maybe drank half a bottle of water yesterday 🙂. 

Basically, why the fuck does Vyvanse do this shit? Did I just take too much and it converted to more D-AMP than I thought it would? Why does it have such little effect on me vs other stimulants? Was it an interaction with my usual meds or the unprescribed meds I took the night before? I’m just confused and need some insight from others, for reference I weigh 156lbs, I’m 6’1, I barely ate and I barely drank, i’ve been on my prescribed medications since mid-October (on and off with switching medications since last summer actually, but I found the right medication for me during October), and I’m a nicotine user.

super realistic hallucinations on mdma??,"okay so i dont know much about mdma at all i do a lot of acid and ketamine but last night was the second time ive done mdma (110 mg capsule thing) and every time i closed my eyes i had these crazy visuals of me just doing stuff like getting up and going downstairs then i would open my eyes and realize i didnt actually do that and it kept repeating

every time i do mdma i get veryyyy mellowed out maybe its my setting (my bedroom) but yesterday the second i felt it start kicking in all i wanted to do was lay under my blanket and close my eyes--also idk if its good-quality mdma i was starting to think it has opiates in it or something from how calm and tired it made me and i dont have testing kits but i took a drug test this morning and all that showed up was amphetamines (BUT ITS WEIRD CAUSE WHEN I TAKE NORMAL AMPHETAMINES I GET SUPER ENERGETIC SO WHY IS MOLLY MAKING ME TIRED)

so for hours i was just listening to music with my eyes closed under the blanket because i would get so overwhelmed when i opened my eyes with my pupils shaking sm and every time i closed my eyes i would immediately started seeing stuff that literally felt like real life and it felt like my eyes were open i kept opening my eyes after a few seconds and realizing the visuals werent real but i was so confused the whole time..... like i had a visual where i moved my arm to grab my phone and text someone but then i remembered to open my eyes and realized i didnt even move an inch or touch my phone it was so weird and these visuals stopped when i took xanax after 4 hours but maybe thats cause the roll ended

whenever i take acid i get visuals yes but its never like this its just patterns but this was completely different hallucinating whole situations and not realizing it i was just wondering if this happens to anyone else cause tbh i dont do a lot of research on the drugs i take but i searched it up this morning and couldnt find anyone who had these intense and realistic visuals on mdma

Opiates for self-reflection and trauma? Experiences?,"Ok hear me out lol idk if this is gonna land me on r/drugscirclejerk but!

I have CPTSD and other mental health issues, basically been through childhood trauma. I’ve had the experience on Kratom before, that I used it for an almost therapeutic effect, I meditated on it and processed some trauma. (And yes, I am in therapy!)

I am on ODSMT right now and wondering if anybody ever used opiates for this kinda stuff. If so, I would love to hear your experiences! 

Are there better suited drugs for this? Sure. Am I saying this to justify using opiates? I don’t know, honestly. Maybe. I’m just wondering, and kind of curious :)  

I just think the relaxing effect and the “safe” feeling you get could be utilized for more. Sitting through very-difficult-to-process feelings, experiences, and so on. Similar to MDMA, where it is already used for trauma processing and people with (C)PTSD, as it lowers your defenses and inhibitions completely. 

And yes, the addiction potential is there, obviously. You have to accept this, I guess. As with any other drug, there’s always a risk. 

I would like to refer to Dr Gabor Maté though, who says “I don’t ask ‘Why the addiction?’, but ‘Why the pain?’”, and according to him, addiction is rooted in the wounds we have from our childhood. I’ve experienced that I don’t feel the need to use substances, when I’m regulated and full in my body. Thus I believe that my need to use substances will decrease as I am moving along the process of uncovering trauma.

I don’t know, I think I might experiment with this a bit.

scary k hole experience,"I was in a k hole the other day - long story short when i was 18-22 i had a few intense k holes, i would always hear this music in my head that wasn't actually playing & it was a really specific song, during the k hole i would know that it was the same song but it never really bothered me, it was scary but after i was out of the k hole, i had forgotten the song & soon forgotten the experience happened. this hasn't happened to me for years but then the other night i went into a k hole & heard the same song again, it really freaked me out & i started to think the song was a scary sign & i really wanted to remember it so i recorded myself singing the song. in the song its a really specific intricate tune that repeats but it doesn't have any coherent lyrics, the lyrics are some sort of gibberish but also consistent with my k hole experiences from years ago, its really really scared me & i cant stop thinking about how my brain can make up a song ive never heard & that it also plays in my head identically from all these years when i go into a k hole (sometimes i k hole & the song isn't playing in my head but still its happened often enough to make me feel weird) i'm wondering if anyone's had the same or a similar experience to put me at ease a bit?? would appreciate some responses, it feels so traumatic i know it's not a big deal but i can't understand how on earth it's the same song & ive never ever heard it before it sounds spiritual - i know a lot of people will say i must have heard the song somewhere before but what if i haven't? is there an explanation? & even if i have heard it before, why do i hear the exact same one if i have a music hallucination during my k hole, it's never anything different ",1,9,2025-01-25 20:35:48,scary k hole experience k hole day long story short 18-22 intense k holes would always hear music head n't actually playing really specific song k hole would know song never really bothered scary k hole forgotten song soon forgotten experience happened n't happened years night went k hole heard song really freaked started think song scary sign really wanted remember recorded singing song song really specific intricate tune repeats n't coherent lyrics lyrics sort gibberish also consistent k hole experiences years ago really really scared cant stop thinking brain make song ive never heard also plays head identically years go k hole sometimes k hole song n't playing head still happened often enough make feel weird 'm wondering anyone 's similar experience put ease bit would appreciate responses feels traumatic know 's big deal ca n't understand earth 's song ive never ever heard sounds spiritual know lot people say must heard song somewhere n't explanation even heard hear exact one music hallucination k hole 's never anything different
Trying Medicinal Cannabis First Time - Bad Experience!,"Hi all,

I’m a 27-year-old male from the UK, and I’m prescribed 20mg of pure THC (0.5ml per night) for my severe migraines.

A couple of days ago, on Tuesday afternoon, I took 0.7ml (0.2ml more than prescribed) at around 3:30pm because I had a bad headache. It didn’t really help much, and I didn’t feel any “high” effects at the time.

Later in the evening, I went out to meet a friend for dinner and started driving. While driving, I began zoning out and feeling extremely anxious, like I was losing control. It honestly felt like I was going to die.

I’ve never used cannabis recreationally before or taken other drugs, so this reaction really freaked me out. I ended up parking the car and calling a family member to pick me up. My heart was racing, and instead of going home, I asked to be taken to the nearest A&E.

At the hospital, the doctors ran tests and found that my heart troponin levels were slightly high, and I also started experiencing mild chest pain. They kept me overnight for observation, and thankfully, all the scans came back clear.

The thing that’s bothering me now is the lingering anxiety, paranoia, and this overwhelming sense of impending doom that comes and goes. It’s not as bad as it was two days ago, but I still feel like I’m not back to my normal self yet.

Has anyone else experienced something like this after taking THC, especially if it was slightly over their prescribed dose? Do these feelings go away? I just want to feel like myself again.",1,4,2025-01-25 20:34:28,trying medicinal cannabis first time bad experience hi ’ 27-year-old male uk ’ prescribed 20mg pure thc 0.5ml per night severe migraines couple days ago tuesday afternoon took 0.7ml 0.2ml prescribed around 3:30pm bad headache ’ really help much ’ feel “ high ” effects time later evening went meet friend dinner started driving driving began zoning feeling extremely anxious like losing control honestly felt like going die ’ never used cannabis recreationally taken drugs reaction really freaked ended parking car calling family member pick heart racing instead going home asked taken nearest e hospital doctors ran tests found heart troponin levels slightly high also started experiencing mild chest pain kept overnight observation thankfully scans came back clear thing ’ bothering lingering anxiety paranoia overwhelming sense impending doom comes goes ’ bad two days ago still feel like ’ back normal self yet anyone else experienced something like taking thc especially slightly prescribed dose feelings go away want feel like
Bazooka bar trip report (5 gummies),"Disclaimer: I'm terrible at writing and this is my first trip report so apologies if it's a bit of a boring read 

Alright, so I know that there is a pretty bad stigma around the 'mushhroom' edibles. Im well aware that it's probably not psilocybin and it is more likely just research chemicals but I honestly don't care. I enjoy them + I can't really get my hands on any real shrooms

I've done acid 2 times, real shrooms once and I've done these bazooka gummies possibly around about 10 times. I took the same amount I always take (5) however yesterday was the most intense trip I've ever had off of them

I started off by taking 3 gummies. I always begin with 3 just to guage how I feel after I come up, If I feel good, I take my other 2. You can always take more, you can NEVER take less. I skinned up a fat joint while I waited for the come up and then I played a game of FIFA... I never really know what to do while I wait for the come up lol. 20 minutes later I was starting to come up, I felt a slight sense of euphoria and colours became really bright and vibrant, I felt good so I took my other 2 gummies.

I was having a good time at this point but I wasnt tripping very hard at all so I waited another half an hour for my other 2 gummies to hit and when they did, I went and smoked my joint. With every drag of my joint I could feel my visuals getting stronger and stronger and eventually it got to the point where my visuals where overwhelming me slightly I decided to put the last half of my joint down and get back into my room. 

This is when the REAL tripping began so it's going to get pretty hard to properly explain what was going on from this point

I got into my room, turned all the lights off and got into bed. I trip alone the majority of the time and recently I've been reading that alot of people say that tripping in a dark room is the absolute best way to trip alone. It does make sense cause if I've got the lights on, I can only see what's in my room... But if I'm in a pitch black room, my mind has to fill in the gaps. This probably explains why this is the most intense trip I've ever had

Not too long after getting into bed, I kinda of forgot about the fact I was in bed. It kinda of looked like I was half on a dark street, and half in my room at the same time. I remember being able to see my TV but at the same time it looked like I was standing on a pavement, I could see what looked like a lampost and patterns/visuals in the shape of cars were driving past me. While this might sound like a pretty cool experience... This was making me feel extremely uneasy and a little bit scared because I couldn't really comprehend what was happening to me. It really did feel like I was outside stood on a street

All of a sudden I could hear someone talking in a quiet and distressed voice. He was saying things like ""what's happening to us?.... What's going on?.... I don't know what to do"" and his words starting getting louder and louder untill eventually he was violently shouting these questions at me.

Now this part is even harder to explain but Ill do my best

After a few minutes of this voice shouting these questions at me I could see a figure on the other side of this 'street' that I was on. The figure was in the shape of a man but (like the cars that were diving past me) it was just patterns and visuals in the shape of a man. He ran over to me, still aggressively shouting at me, and was about to hpunch me... But then at, the exact second when he was about to hit me, he would be on the other side of the street again and the whole thing would repeat itself. The best way to explain it would be to say that it was kind of like I was in a gif, with this man continuously running over to me and trying to attack me but never actually hitting me.

I was feeling a type of fear that I had never felt before at this point it's honestly undescribable. I've never had a bad trip before but I know that the only thing you can do is just surrender and accept what ever is going on. It really did feel like I would never go back to normal again and this was going to go on for eternity, but once I fully submitted and realised that this was beyond my controll I stopped feeling scared. It still felt like I would never be normal again but I was completely okay with this

At this point, a second voice started speaking to me and this voice belonged to who I can only assume to be my subconscious. It felt like the person speaking was me but I was able to communicate and have a conversation with this voice in my mind. This voice was alot more peacefull and friendly and it reminded me that I needed to breathe, I listened. After I controlled my breathing, my subconscious reminded me that I was in my room and even tho it still looked like I was on that dark street, I could feel that I was laying in my bed. 

The fact that I could feel my bed really bought me back to reality. The strange figure was still endlessly running towards me and shouting at me me but knowing that I was actually in my bed made me feel safe and reminded me off the fact that I had taken those gummies and I was just tripping. It really just ended like that. I went from feeling immense fear to immense relief.

From that point untill coming down, I was still on that street but it was nice now. That figure was still there but he wasn't running up to me anymore. He was still shouting and all though I can't remember what he was saying... I do remember bursting out laughing quite a few times.

Over all it was an incredible thing to experience, regardless of how scared I was feeling at the start. I'm glad I surrendered instead of fighting it and I'm glad that my subconscious saved me lol. I will be exclusively tripping in dark rooms now it's honestly a different experience and now that I know what to expect, I have a feeling it's going to be so much better next time.

boofing morphine fail?? help,"i dont use opiods too often, but recently came into posession of a few 10mg statex morphine tablets. last night i took 30mg orally and felt pretty good. so today i decided to try and boof it so that i could conserve my limited supply. 

i tried to follow a guide online and heres what i did: crushed up 1 morphine tablet in a bowl, added 2 mL of microwaved hot water to the crushed morphine, it turns a blueish color but didn’t perfectly dissolve. then i get my solution in the oral syringe and shove it in my ass. even at this point i could see the solution was not perfectly dissolved id guess i got it about an inch or so in my butt and slowly squeezed out the morphine water. when i finished there was still some powdery bits from the pill left in the syringe. and im not really feeling much effects (its been about 20 minutes).

so im wondering did i fuck up? i followed a guide on reddit but im not sure if i was supposed to use hotter water maybe and fully dissolve the pill? when boofing is it normal for the pill binders to remain undissolved? please any experienced boofers let me know where i might have went wrong. im going to try again later and dont want to be disappointed in myself for sticking a syringe in my butt and wasting a pill without even getting high again.

Question on the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis,"I've read that stimulants cause psychosis by increasing the amount of dopamine released by neurons in the brain. People with non-drug induced psychosis like schizophrenia also have increased dopamine activity in specific region of the brain due to them having an overactive dopamine receptor I believe. In both scenarios, excess dopamine transmission in a specific brain region causes psychosis. Both are treated with antipsychotics ( dopamine receptor blockers).
However, once meth is metabolized and the high fades, dopamine levels return to normal or even below normal due to dopamine depletion. So why does psychosis persist even after the high if dopamine is no longer abnormally high? I haven't used meth in six months and still have mild hallucinations.

The worst part about drugs,"Is when there are none. 

Disclaimer: Gonna vent a bit but I swear it relates to drugs lol

There's honestly not very much I look forward to most days because everything kinda just happens and then stops happening. Other than cleaning and maintaining myself, my environment, and the people around me, i don't really care to do much. 

Media and art is nice, but gets boring quick and I hate overconsuming, it takes away from being able to appreciate it. Creating it is also fun, but it's expensive, takes more time than I'm willing to spend not enjoying myself, and I don't like the whole capitalism part of it. 

Jobs are hell, and I'm not selling my body for 16 fucking dollars an hour, and I can never enjoy the money, plus all the shit I do just to get the first paycheck makes me tired and depressed. 

I have some bad body pain (hypermobile related), anxiety that makes me feel inhuman, adhd that makes me too bored to do anything that doesn't give me enough dopamine, and a medley of things that make living pasively a struggle, but I have to jump through so many hoops for medication. 

Not to say I don't enjoy living, i love being alive, despite everything, but my own head doesn't give me enough to ENJOY bring alive. 

Enter: DRUGS! 
Opiates, amphetamines, weed, dissociatives, psychedelics, the most fun, memorable, and meaningful experiences of my life happened with at least one of these in my bag. 

Getting addicted to meth and almost dying (i was going through a rough time) showed me how people loved me, even if they don't convey it to me well. MDA made me feel beautiful for the first time, and mushrooms taught me about the world. Adderall and meth made life feel FUN, any part of it, whatever I wanted. Ketamine has a habit of showing up when I need it, and some of my favourite sex happened on it. Opiates... Oh god, opiates. I had control of my life every minute I was high. 

More than anything, having the option to do them made every decision I had to make feel meaningful. I'm forced to choose whether I value myself or my circle more, and I've had to evaluate my identity and how much it means more times than i can count on my hands. 

Being sober is boring. Can't think, can't eat, and I'm so sensitive to pain in ways I don't like. Get a fucking vicodin in me, and I feel refreshed, I get to actually *enjoy* the things I wanna do instead of bothering about my health or the world too much. 

Anyway, I'm out of everything, and I'm alone again, got days before I can see any of my loved ones and weeks before I can get a goofy ahh chemical. Being poor sucks dude fr.

I am one of the pills from the toolbox.,"Hey Reddit,
So, uh… this is weird to explain, but I’m one of the pills from that toolbox everyone’s talking about. Yeah, that toolbox. The one with the bars and the opiates. I’m a Xanax bar, to be exact. Name’s Xanny (yes, like the song, haha).

Anyway, I’ve been chilling in that toolbox for months, just vibing with my pill buddies. We had a good thing going—Opie (the Oxy) would tell us stories about all the wild parties he’s been to, and I’d just sit there, doing what I do best: making people forget their problems. Life was simple, you know?

Will pregabalin be enough to manage withdrawal after a couple of months of heavy codeine use?,"Story time. For the past two months, I’ve been heavily using dihydrocodeine, and I’ve noticed the withdrawal symptoms when I don’t take it—nausea, stomach pain, anxiety, insomnia, and restless leg syndrome (RLS). I’ve decided to start weaning off, and today is my first day dropping from four tablets to two. It’s a tough adjustment, but I’m determined to push through and regain control.

However, I’ve quickly found that tolerance has become a significant issue. At this point, even taking six tablets barely has any noticeable effect other than giving me a dry mouth. The relief I used to feel is almost nonexistent, and I’m increasingly aware that continuing at higher doses isn’t sustainable. I’ve realized that I need to address this dependence now before it gets worse.

I’m also prescribed 400mg of pregabalin, and I’ve noticed it helps immensely with symptoms like anxiety, RLS, and sleep. Because of this, I’m considering temporarily increasing my pregabalin dosage to 600mg or 800mg to help manage withdrawal symptoms and make the process more manageable. It’s been my go-to for relief, and I’m hopeful that a short-term adjustment could ease the worst of the transition. I’m also prescribed medical cannabis which helps. 

That said, I’m cautious about making changes without proper guidance. While I’m committed to getting through this, I want to ensure I’m taking the right steps to manage my symptoms effectively and safely. Will increasing the pregabalin dose work as a temporary measure? I can’t imagine being completely head over the heals addicted to opioids, any other withdrawal side effects I need to be concerned about? Thanks!

Kitty flipping for the first time?,"Hey all! Hope you're enjoying the weekend. I am an experienced ketamine user and have done mdma on multiple occasions as well, but never together.

Falsely Accused of a Murder Plot and Kicked Out of Rehab—When I Was Finally Doing Better,"I (23M) have been in and out of treatment for the past two years after giving up my life overseas to focus on recovery. During that time, I was either in treatment or entirely consumed by drug use, so there’s a lot at stake for me.

My track record with treatment isn’t great—I’ve left AMA (against medical advice) or been discharged from nine different facilities. But this past August, I finally completed my first-ever 30 days without incident, and I started to feel grounded in my recovery.

After that, I transferred to what seemed like my dream PHP program: young, supportive people, music groups, great housing, and a structured setup to help phase out of treatment. It felt like the perfect place to rebuild my life.

But then things went sideways. I tested positive for something I didn’t use, got sent home, relapsed, and was eventually readmitted. Unfortunately, my cravings restarted, and I relapsed again, which led to another discharge. They transferred me to a lower-quality program without my informed consent and told me I could return if I completed 30 days elsewhere.

That sent me into a spiral. I started using again, faked drug tests, and fell deeper into addiction. After another failed test and discharge, I spent a month using at home before going to Arizona to detox alone. Those three weeks were hell—ER visits, getting robbed, kicked out of places—but I pushed through, determined to get back to the PHP program I believed in.

I completed 30 days, felt more stable than ever, and returned to the program ready to give it my all. I genuinely thought this time was different.

Then a housemate flipped out on me over something trivial—putting her laundry in the wrong basket—and called me slurs. I didn’t engage or escalate the situation, and she was moved to a different house. I thought the drama was over.

But a few days later, my counselor called me in to discuss “disturbing” allegations. Apparently, this girl’s friends claimed I’d made violent threats, which stemmed from a harmless joke I made to my own friends about the guy who had robbed me in Arizona. They jokingly asked if we should “go after him,” and I sarcastically replied, “Yeah, I’ve got the address lol.” That was the end of it.

Despite the context, they discharged me without any real investigation. They didn’t speak to my friends, and the accusations came from people who had already harassed me. For once, I was following the rules, doing everything right, and genuinely making progress. I worked so hard to get back there, only to be thrown out over something so ridiculous.

I sacrificed so much to make this program work. Now it’s all gone because of petty drama and poor decision-making on their part. I’m crushed. Hopefully, they realize how badly they screwed up by Monday, but for now, I’m just lost.

How much codeine to get high?,"So I happen to have 30 mg codeine pills that also have 550 mg naproxen in them. I used to pop 10 of them to get an okay high, but I had an oxy tolerance back then (I'd snort 70 mg of oxycodone HCl, pharma grade). Now I've had a mandatory oxy break because I lost my source, and I forgot that I have codeine pills. It's been over 40-50 days since my last oxy trip, and I haven't used any other opioids meanwhile. I'm planning to do CWE this time, so how much pills should I extract. Please don't tell me to do less than I need to get high to begin with, I started oxy with 20-40 mg, so I already had a high tolerance as a first timer. Any tips are appreciated.

Why does HPPD happen to me? I am not paranoid.," opposite of acquired Aphantasia. Your brain has essentially become aware that its capable of projecting these 3D hallucinations and when you use drugs the gained autonomy allows it to independently project it. Strength of ability varies like levels Aphantasia.
Sure, they don't know what exactly is causing this but the most likely case is damage to nerve connections involved in visual processing after levels of regionally vital neurotransmitters; in this case primarily acetylcholine, dip dangerously low and/or lower than ever before.
You'll get used to it and if your lucky the intensity of hallucinations will decrease as the years go on I guess.

Any impulse control tips taking Ritalin? I totally overdid it and now I'm almost all out.,"So uh: *20mg = 1 pill*

Little context I’m writing this completely sleep deprived an I haven’t slept in 48 hours- not that I’m tired or my body is buzzing with energy and keep running my hands through my hair more so to feel the texture of it the anything else really.

Okay soo last night around 7 pm I decided to take about 40mg of Ritalin because pills were just in my purse, laying there, looking pretty lonely. Ritalin is meant to be taken and I was pretty bored. Fortunately for me I had a brilliant idea for a short story and sat down to outline it. 

A couple of hours later, it’s around 11 pm or so I’m hunched over in bed, trying to edit the outline of my short story. ( Which I’ve given up since you can’t edit perfection ) I decide to take another 20mg, just to keep up the momentum. 

So at around 1 am I’m still hung up on my story but I’m wondering whether the effects of the Ritalin had worn off, cause I’m not getting anywhere. Plus the whole \*magic rush\* sensation I’d felt six hours earlier had gone away. Instead of taking this opportunity to fall asleep, I decided to take about 60mg more. 

((And correct me if I’m wrong but i think it would be the first 40mg that hard worn off, but the 20mg was still working i'm pretty certain. So I had taken 6 pills, 3 of which being for no real reason))

So I don’t take another dose until around four to six am I think– I was too caught up in my work to pay attention to it. At this point I was kinda like, hm maybe this isn’t a good idea. Unfortunately I didn’t listen and took more. I can’t recall whether it was 40 mg or 60 mg but I took it anyway. 

Cut two hours later, im making myself iced coffee and im pretending to go about my day as if I actually have slept the past 48 hours– which was easier than expected to be honest. 

THEN I take the final pill. A simple 20mg to go along with my iced coffee and food I couldn’t be bothered to make…. So thats about it for what happened,

Kinda ironic that my impulse control kinda just went \**poof* \* when I took this thing, even though its supposed to help with my ADHD... Anyway I need advice on how to better control the impulse when it comes so that I don't end up swallowing the whole bottle in one go.

Literally you’re floating and falling at the same time. You see everything, and you’re so happy. So much happier than when you’re smoking weed. I could feel myself get sick like I wanted to throw up, but I just reminded myself “you’re just uncomfortable, uncomfortable without death means growth. You’re growing”. The visuals weren’t even when you were keeping your eyes open, they were the strongest when you closed them. Just closing your eyes and feeling yourself let loose, being free. It was so, soo?? So happy!


And molly?? I just thought it’d be like a happier adderall, like if you smoked weed before. When I felt my mushroom trip dying down I decided to try molly for the first time and ride the high again


Again dead wrong. It just added to the visuals, everything was so strong and moving, and whatever you were doing was the only thing that existed. If you closed your eyes for just a few minutes you could live a whole short day in your head.


I started tonight thinking that this would just be a chill night, try shrooms and molly for the first time, be nothing since I’ve done coke before and I’m so badass. Turned into me living the past “50 years” in my bed putting my fingers in my mouth while listening to music and talking to my now gf. (Literally got together while high) while also sending a sorry essay to my ex and clearing up my other situationships. Tonight was the first night I felt true freedom and happiness, I’m grateful and will strive to be this free in my daily life:)",1,3,2025-01-25 09:11:29,molly shrooms first time long post ’ funny end u wan na skip holy shit underestimated fuck 2.35g chocolate bar +149ish mgs molly thought shrooms would like weed trippy distortions dude literally ’ floating falling time see everything ’ happy much happier ’ smoking weed could feel get sick like wanted throw reminded “ ’ uncomfortable uncomfortable without death means growth ’ growing ” visuals ’ even keeping eyes open strongest closed closing eyes feeling let loose free soo happy molly thought ’ like happier adderall like smoked weed felt mushroom trip dying decided try molly first time ride high dead wrong added visuals everything strong moving whatever thing existed closed eyes minutes could live whole short day head started tonight thinking would chill night try shrooms molly first time nothing since ’ done coke ’ badass turned living past “ 50 years ” bed putting fingers mouth listening music talking gf literally got together high also sending sorry essay ex clearing situationships tonight first night felt true freedom happiness ’ grateful strive free daily life
Am I at risk for pregabalin/Lyrica WDs,"Hey guys, I have had the following pattern of use for Lyrica these last three months: one day I'd take 600mg, next day nothing, then 600 again and so on. Over the last few weeks I'd do 600mg one day, then 900mg, then a tolerance break day so the 600 hit again the next day.


But now I'm out....and won't get any until like mondaY prolly. Though I could go drive to the nearest big city and ask my dealer for some. 

At home I have methadone (I'm in maintenance, though I'm so used to my dose I hardly notice it anymore. But still, opioid receptors will be nice and full) and Benzos (Ativan and k-pins) , as well as ibuprofen for the headaches.


Am I good like that? Or should I head out to see my dealer? Last dosage was 48h ago (900mg) I feel ok.

4 years ago i posted in this group excited about finding an old man who was prescribed percocets.,"4 years ago i posted in this group (now deleted) about how excited i was to finally find a new person to buy drugs (percocet) from. i didn’t buy from just anyone so it felt like finding a needle in a haystack. 

4 years of being a functional and fully aware addict. 4 years of withdrawals, 4 years of constantly having a runny nose. 4 painful years of massive explosive diarrhea.. the kind that comes whenever it wants to and you better be close to a bathroom. 

today i am now 20 days sober, today is also my drug dealers reup day, finally today is the day i delete and block that number and never look back. 

the last time i got high i looked in the mirror and didn’t even recognize myself. i told myself my daughter deserves a better mother and that’s exactly what she’s going to get. a present mom, a mom who isn’t tired all the time, a mom who doesn’t want to get out of bed because she ran out of drugs. 

maybe this isn’t the right group for this kind of post but if you’re struggling with opiates just know you can kick this habit in the ass!

My buddy stole someone's drugs,"He said they were out in the trees in a toolbox, a bag of Xanax and opioids, they were probably cut but he didn't care, a few hours later he came up to me and started freaking out about the cartel coming for him, I tried telling him that they wouldn't know it's him and to calm down. 

Come to find he went up to the apparent owner and told him he stole his drugs and that he's sorry, suddenly two jacked pickup trucks rolled up and he got shot multiple times. The police said it might've been the cartel, I feel like such a piece of shit. I'm sitting here praying for his survival as he fights for his life because I didn't believe him.

Meth not getting me high?,"

I'm new to meth. My first time ever trying it was last September and I snorted.
My second time was in December, also snorting. Both of these times I experienced the best things I've heard about the high and some of the bad things, but not too bad.

My third time was 2 weeks ago and I've been doing it every day. In these last 2 weeks I have not gotten high...
I've been smoking it and snorting it and I'm not getting anything out of it other than being a little calm and thinking slightly different.
Maybe I'm smoking it wrong? But the clouds are there. I'm not burning it. I am retarded though so maybe I am somehow wasting it.
I was also thinking it was the quality but I've been smoking with a heavy addict most of these two weeks and she'll be tweaking of the same shit I just hit. 

Today was my last day trying to get a high off of it. It's just making my gums and teeth hurt while I watch my friends have a blast on the shit. I would even take a bad high over no high...something. I also don't get any of the side effects after smoking. I can sleep (some days it made me sleepy), eat like a fat bitch, not horny in the slightest, and I'm mostly quiet and observant.

Anyways, over the two weeks I've been so confused about this. I don't know shit about meth so maybe I'm missing something or doing something wrong.
I also want to add that I'm not posting this to try to find out how to make meth work for me. I know how addicting it is. 
Today was my last day fucking with it. And after trying to get high off of it for two weeks 
I'm just frustrated, confused and pissed off.

I'm posting this to see if anyone can explain why I had this experience or if anyone can relate to it.

Tried valium as naive user.,"I recently tried valium got blisters from a credible source, I'm completely benzo naive and I bought it for the pleasure or eurphoria because I want to try something different I'm a oxycotin user and dont want to be constantly taking it to avoid high tolerance. My concern is that I took 20mgs and I blacked out for 2 hours and woke up and I didnt really feel any relaxing effects after I awakened, next day I decreased the dose to 15 valium and blacked out again for 2-3 hours and not really any relaxing effect when I woke up, today im going to trying 10mgs and see how that goes, but in my opinion this drug seems like its only good for sedation not really pleasure kind of disappointing.

If I drink grapefruit juice will it affect insullfation,So I drank a glass of grapefruit juice yesterday before taking some gabapentin to up the bioavailability and today I just snorted 4mg of diluadid.

Just wondering cause I feel a lot higher than I usually do right after I snorted. I felt it almost instantly but it usually takes about 10 minutes. And these are skripts I’m pretty sure so I don’t think I’m bout die from fent lol.

Concerta vs Adderall,"I’m not sure if this is even allowed but idk where else to ask. 

I’ve taken adderall/Vyvanse orally recreationally probably half a dozen times in my adult life (30yo) and have always had great, non habit forming experiences with it. My most recent use, I got an 3 hours sleep before a plane ride, then went to drink and tailgate at a football game for 8 hours. I took 30mg of IR addy at 10am, drank and ate, then another 30 at around 1pm and continued to eat and drink. Beers were going down like water and I never got like blackout or too drunk. I felt amazing throughout the day and night, although I did have trouble sleeping later that night. 

I am doing the exact same thing again, and I’ll be getting just as little sleep, needing that “pick me up” to keep me going thru the tailgating and game. Only problem this time is, I can only get concerta 54mg. I know these are much slower and kind of slow drip compared to addys, but I wanna still feel the same as I did taking that 30/30 dose. 

Should i take 54mg instead of 30, and that’ll be fine? Or should I crush up the concerta? Or is that insanely dangerous? Just trying to see the best way to get the same effects as the 30/30 IRs.

All drugs I’ve tried (not too many),"Legal where I live

Nicotine 4/10 - yes I’m counting this, it’s nice but is super addictive and has made me sick every time except 1 time. 

Alcohol 8/10 - I have sever anxiety and this takes it away for this reason I don’t use it often but when I do it’s always a good time.

Caffeine 6/10 - quiets my mind (suspected ADHD) and gives me a good sleep 

Cannabis and related

Thc 8/10 - only used a handful of times (not got a reliable source) was nice when I tried it but got a bit paranoid.

Hhc 8/10 - mixed emotions had some great times but also sent me into psychosis once so have cut down usage a lot.

MDMB-4en-PINACA (most common spice where I’m located) 5/10 - amazing experience super psychedelic like but obviously super addictive and tolerance builds super quick I’ve only done it once but it messed my friend up for a while.

Opiods/opiates 

Morphine 9/10 - liked it way to much pure bliss 

Codeine 9/10 - I’m a good metaboliser so can get some really nice high from codeine.
 
Dihydrocodeine 10/10 - In Europe this is what’s prescribed instead of hydrocodone (in most places I believe could be wrong though) it is weaker but many heroin user say this is the closed in euphoria you just have to take a lot I had so much euphoria with this it was crazy.

Gabapentinoids 

Gabapentin 9/10 - loved it it’s like a combo of lots of other drugs.

Hypnotics

vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) advice?,"hi everyone, this is my (17m) first time on this sub. i don't do any drugs on a regular basis, but I have toyed around with dxm, codeine, and (predictably) alcohol, and now im taking vyvanse daily. i was recently diagnosed with adhd (legitimately, I wasnt just trying to get meds) so ive only been on it for about 6 weeks, and I recently just upped the dose to 40mg, and to be honest, i love it. its mildly euphoric, keeps me super focused, and the extended release means its smooth and pleasant for many hours. my only worry is that i find myself wanting to try and get high on it, i dont want to become addicted and fuck up my dopamine levels and shit. With all the other shit i toyed around with it was just experimenting - I liked tripping on dxm plenty but i dont find myself craving it or anything and ive only done it maybe 4-5 times at doses around 500mg (also trying to avoid cognitive decline with regular drug use, i do well in school and all that so id prefer to retain my mental faculties). so if anybody has more experience with vyvanse, what the high feels like, what it did for you, side effects, etc. id love to hear about it, especially as someone who's not a regular drug user.",0,8,2025-01-25 03:01:46,vyvanse lisdexamfetamine advice hi everyone 17m first time sub n't drugs regular basis toyed around dxm codeine predictably alcohol im taking vyvanse daily recently diagnosed adhd legitimately wasnt trying get meds ive 6 weeks recently upped dose 40mg honest love mildly euphoric keeps super focused extended release means smooth pleasant many hours worry find wanting try get high dont want become addicted fuck dopamine levels shit shit toyed around experimenting liked tripping dxm plenty dont find craving anything ive done maybe 4-5 times doses around 500mg also trying avoid cognitive decline regular drug use well school id prefer retain mental faculties anybody experience vyvanse high feels like side effects etc id love hear especially someone 's regular drug user

Living with  Drug Addicts,"I live with my girlfriend in her mother’s house. (Mother has a druggie Boyfriend)We’ve got half the house to ourselves and the other half is theirs. GF has walked into her room where she’s lighting the underneath of aluminum foil using a straw to inhale whatever the fuck they’re doing. 

They are actively destroying the house, they have 3 dogs that never go outside; Pee pads for days and the floor looks like it’s rotting. They have black mold in their bathroom and do not plan on fixing it. The heat has just broken the other day and they have no money to fix it. I was dumb enough to give her some money thinking she actually needed something important. I give her the money they leave the house buy said drugs, then proceed to nodding off all afternoon. They looked dead mouth wide open looking up at the ceiling. My GF has basically lost any attachment to her mother as she always picks drugs or her abusive BF over her. We’ve talked to her about putting the house in GF’s name but she will never actually go to do that. We’ve thought about calling the cops and having them arrested or something. We just have no idea how to approach this situation and need help.

Correct way meth - vapor vs. smoke,"Hi, I want to know if it's truly possible to smoke meth in the very cheapest, simplest, bowl glass pipe. (a simple round bowl with a hole on top and a glass straw coming out the side).  If I understand right, in order to get the high, it's important NOT to actually heat it so hot that it smokes - but rather, that it emits vapor, which is a totally different substance and is what you want to inhale.

So is it really possible to successfully ""smoke meth"" in a simple bowl pipe with a lighter as long as you're careful to hold the lighter a good distance away from the bowl bottom, and wait patiently for a while until you see vapor come off?  

I've definitely tried the 'wrong way' before, where I easily created tons of white smoke, but inhaling it did me absolutely nothing. So I""m fishing for an explanation of the right away - using that cheap type pipe.",3,5,2025-01-24 20:47:15,correct way meth vapor vs. smoke hi want know 's truly possible smoke meth cheapest simplest bowl glass pipe simple round bowl hole top glass straw coming side understand right order get high 's important actually heat hot smokes rather emits vapor totally different substance want inhale really possible successfully `` smoke meth '' simple bowl pipe lighter long 're careful hold lighter good distance away bowl bottom wait patiently see vapor come 've definitely tried 'wrong way easily created tons white smoke inhaling absolutely nothing '' fishing explanation right away using cheap type pipe
Is MDMA a bad drug to offer someone with no drug experience?,"My boyfriend isn't really into drugs at all; he smokes weed with me when we hang out but not on his own, and doesn't touch anything else. I've told him about me doing shrooms and ketamine recently and he has been chill with it.

Since he's maybe more open to the idea than I thought, I was wondering if it would be a bad idea to suggest for him to try MDMA with me? I've never done it before, but I was hoping for my first roll to be with someone like... my boyfriend... yknow :)

Just wondering if anyone thinks the experience might be a bit much for someone who's only ever done weed (and alcohol). I'm confident I'll be able to handle myself and enjoy it since I have a lot of experience with other drugs, but I'm worried that he might not have fun if he's not used to stuff like comeup anxiety/nausea, general side effects of being on drugs, or the comedown the next day. 

Since I haven't actually done MDMA yet, I just don't know how extreme the effects or side effects will be (just on a regular dose, like 120mg). Are they bad enough that I shouldn't subject him to that? Should I start with trying to get him to do shrooms or something instead?

Any insight appreciated!

First Psilocybin Journey in a While – Any Tips or Advice?,"

Hey everyone, I’m planning a psilocybin journey soon (2.5g Golden Teachers) and feeling a mix of excitement and nerves since it’s been a while. I’d love to hear if I’m missing anything or if you have any tips to make it a great experience. Last decent trip was first time in 20 years and was great and was 2.2g. 

Here’s my plan:
	•	When: Tomorrow morning, dosing around 9-9:30 AM after fasting since 6:30 AM.
	•	Where: Upstairs in my computer room. It’s bright in the morning (no blinds), but I have a blindfold if needed.
	•	Setup: Comfy chairs, candles that change colors, my journal, and access to my bedroom if I want to lie down.
	•	Music: I have a psilocybin-specific playlist, AirPods, and noise-cancelling Bose headphones.
	•	Distractions: Laptop for Netflix or journaling if I want a change of pace.
	•	Support: My wife knows and will be downstairs with the puppies from 9-1 in case I need anything.

Does this setup sound good? Any tips or things I might be missing? I appreciate any advice to ease my nerves and make this a smooth journey!",1,0,2025-01-25 02:19:35,first psilocybin journey – tips advice hey everyone ’ planning psilocybin journey soon 2.5g golden teachers feeling mix excitement nerves since ’ ’ love hear ’ missing anything tips make great experience last decent trip first time 20 years great 2.2g ’ plan • tomorrow morning dosing around 9-9:30 fasting since 6:30 • upstairs computer room ’ bright morning blinds blindfold needed • setup comfy chairs candles change colors journal access bedroom want lie • music psilocybin-specific playlist airpods noise-cancelling bose headphones • distractions laptop netflix journaling want change pace • support wife knows downstairs puppies 9-1 case need anything setup sound good tips things might missing appreciate advice ease nerves make smooth journey

Too obsessed with drugs?,"I'm obsessed with drugs and not just taking them but learning about them. My favourite things is trip reports and learning about the psychological effects of different substances. Especially psychedelics and delirants, even getting interested about inhalants. I also quite enjoy learning about the chemicals, physical effects, withdrawals etc.

But I feel like I can't talk to people irl. All I wanna do is talk about and learn about drugs. But obviously to most people that is weird and looked down upon. I have autism as well so I get hyper fixated and I just feel like there's basically no one irl to talk too and it fucking sucks and its annoying.
I mean at work if I talked about it I'd probably get fired or at the very least be seen as weird and strange. Other situations tend to be people who are very narrow minded and think drugs are always bad and no good can come from them, and people just don't accept it.

Cocaine was alright. Acid is way cooler though.,"My group of friends used to do acid every weekend together, mushrooms sometimes, but somewhere along the way cocaine got introduced. 

I held out for years, but this last year I decided to try it. Had a good time the first 2 or 3 times, during some celebrations, but around Christmas we got together and I decided to get some acid instead. They all decided to do the coke instead, but i stuck to the acid. Still had a great time, and fun was had all around. Hell, I had more fun than usual.

So this last time we gathered, they brought coke again, and I had acid, but I decided to see how it felt compared to the recent chillin with acid. Turns out, the coke was just disappointing. Just didn't do it like acid does. Plus the nose problems suck for the next week. It's way more expensive... 

I think I'm just over coke. Only had it a handful of times, but meh. 5 out of 10, don't really recommend.

I think I got lucky due to my amphetamine tolerance,"Never really post anything on reddit, but I’ve been lurking on this subreddit for a while and thought I might share an experience which really shook me. 

I’ve diagnosed ADHD and OCD which means I have access to certain prescription drugs, such as 70mg vyvanse, 60mg vyvanse, 5mg dexamphetamine tablets, 50mg sertraline, and 25mg strattera. Now don’t get me wrong, I take these medications the way I am meant to most of the time, yet in the last month or so I’d say I took more than my daily dose of stimulants, going from 70mg vyvanse and 10mg Dex to like 140mg vyvanse and 60mg Dex. Reason why? Not trying to chase that feeling which most people get when they first try an amphetamine, but rather get that rush/buzz which is really pleasant and helps me study for my exams. Yet yesterday I kinda stuffed up and took way more than I should have, which resulting in me ending up in the ER. Yesterday morning I took a liquid which makes my stomach have a more basic pH to allow the amphetamines to absorb better, and right after this I took a 6mg zyn and 70mg vyvanse. I won’t waffle the next 4 hours but from 12:00PM to 4:00PM I ended up taking 6 x 70mg vyvanse, 6 x 60mg vyvanse, 53 x 5mg dexamphetamine, and 1 more 6mg zyn. Reason? I always complain that I can’t feel my meds at my usual dose (I know I just ruined it with this event), and I s couldn’t feel it after 4 aswell until I started getting a shortness of breath and a very strong beating heart (around 127BPM sitting down). 
Funniest part is, I didn’t feel the buzz or anything at all, I genuinely believe I would’ve gotten a better feeling if I just took a one week drug break. Anyways, I went down to the emergency department as I realised the extent of the situation I just put myself in.

Paracetamol/Codeine CWE first time question.,"Hi all!

Planning on CWE extracting 30 tablets this weekend which will be 384mg codeine (12.8mg tablets)

Once I've got my clear liquid do I drink it all in one go? Or sip it? I've seen posts saying both so a tad confused.

Also, what's the best amount of water to use for 30 tablets 12.8mg/500mg? 

Or is this completely unsafe as its 15000mg paracetamol?

I have a high tolerance, I have a prescription monthly for 30mg codeine - 224 tablets each month so just using the CWE for when I run out.

I've never actually done a CWE before but bought everything I need and using guides found on here.

All drugs are legalised except one. Whats your pick?,"My pick is weed.

I see weed as a retard drug, more harmful to society than any other drug. Pot smokers are generally obnoxious hippies or teens. Pot creates brain damaged, lazy, dull persons from otherwise perfectly fine individuals. Other side effects are cringey laugh, “one with a nature mantra” and infantile music. If drug are in group effect is exponentially amplified.

My best and worst high,"My Best high. Also most intense

I know weed doesn't usually cause these effects and it could be sleep deprevation. One or my best highs happened when i was on a  bender, only sleeping for 3 hours a day. If that.
48 hours staying up, high for almost every hour. Normal for the first 48 hours. night one I did not notice anything I stayed up all night for 2 nights I did it again tonight, I did not notice anything other than the pleasant euphoric weed high , after getting into bed I start to notice unusual effects, I first hear voices, hear my dad angrily complain about me. I could never hear them with my music on before I figured it wasn't real, then I began to feel bugs on my body in bed, in my underwear and on my legs mostly, but anywhere on my body. I often get this feeling but it was almost painful I had to check to see that it wasn't there to stop the sensation,  I felt a tug on the bedsheets, I didn't look but I felt the bedsheets being tugged slightly. Then I closed my eyes,  I open them slowly and say this black wave pattern when my eyes were half closed, my closed eye visuals are never anything exciting. Its more fun with my eyes open holding the smoke in until i cant any longer. Towards the end of the  next night I realised the letters on my phone were completely bizarre, some letters were white, others were blue , it looked like some letters were half white and half blue. This was a memorable hallucination for me because i hasn't experienced something like that before. The next night and 2nd last it was all usual I was super high. Near the end of the bender I noticed a cloth hung over a chair and in my peripheral vision it looked like there was a person with the cloth as his shirt and he was peeking out , and shadow people ocassionly in the mirror. Though always in my peripheral vision. That day and previous nights were one of my best highs because i felt euphoric and that everything was perfect. The day after I got just 2 hours of sleep and I planned to stay up again but unfortunately I passed out for 10 hours which is very unusual for me to not wake up at least once. Anyway that screwed my plans to have fun because in order to play my playstayion I would have to get it out of the bag and untangle all the wires which took 10 minutes, after doing that almost ready to play my dad was up and he was yelling at me because I was up I calmly explained I fell asleep. At 7pm woke up and missed the chance to play my game, then he yelled at me saying I'm smoking too much I said it doesn't kill people it's not a bad thing, he got in my face and yelled at me, I saw his mouth muscles twitch in anger like he was restraining himself He gets like this towards me but it always for some dumb petty reason and we normally get along, because of the bad start the bad vibes continued and the playstation didn't turn on despite everything being plugged in and ready, I was sober pissed off and had been yelled at for smoking too much, which us stupid because there is no such thing as too much, not even 20 cones. .I  definitely reached my dads too much limit as he is a lightweight who doesn't exceed a joint or 3 pipes in a day, I meanwhile smoke at least 2 grams a day more like 5 to 7 and don't count how many cones I am smoking. That was the end of the bender. 




Worst high I have had.

I was high and enjoying myself i asked for tea in a metal mug and dad came back with it, I was expecting it to be a little hot at most but when I took a sip I felt extreme burning pain on my tongue mouth and throat I spit it out and say you arsehole to my dad, It was boiling water, later I was in a car with my best friend H telling him about it,  i said that my dad gave me tea which was literally boiling water it hurt like hell and told my friend H that my dad fucked up and made a gigantic mistake, H said that that is not a mistake, that is a serious fuck up, I began to feel really angry but I can't deal with it and immediately lost control because i find myself not being able to control myself if I talk about negative things which causes me to feel negative when im high when im high everything has to be perfect and happy and extreme unexpected physical pain is not tolerable, it ruined my high and i deeply wish thay i could of experienced this worst physical pain ive felt for years when im sober and not high so it wouldnt be even worse than being sober and ruin my high if you ask me anything negative happening when im high is more negative than when im sober because my senses and feelings are amplified.

I threw the container of boiling water spilling it over the car, my friend proceeded to get angry and threatened to kick me out of the car, we never fight normally and the fact that he was being mean to me while i was high made me think he was getting some satisfaction out of it. He said I'd have to walk 5 kilometres home while high but i could not handle the situation because i was high i wish i was sober so i could process the negative situation normally I just said over and over stop it stop talking negative stop talking negative, it made him angry but thankfully he didn't escalate the situation, I told him that it was boiling water and to confirm it was unscrewed the lid and poured some on my hand it was very hot I felt extreme pain again once it made contact with my hand and saw steam rise from the water. The pain was awful but not as bad as when I had the boiling water in my mouth.When we got home I spoke to my dad andi tried to get him to put his hand out to see how hot the water was and he immediately said no and got aggressive and said  to let me do it,

 I wasn't aggressive at all, then I told him that it was boiling water, he said to my face, I told you to take little sips, it's not my fault amd some other small detail I forgot but i said that he put boiling water in there and seriously expected me to drink it and I said it is his fault he burned me and he should apologise, he said nothing. He made fun of me for being high and was acting like because i was high i wasnt making sense. Damn well i was, at this point my dad got aggressive and said i was being aggressive, he said it's not my fault and to leave me alone, I kept saying it was boiling water and you can't just not tell me that it will literally burn the inside of my mouth and i want an apology, then he proceeded to slam the door on me and walked to my mum but so was I, when he was talking to mum I was standing behind him and I clearly heard him say to my mum , he is being a shit he is going off on me like I'm a bother to him when clearly he was the one to blame for making such an amateur mistake, he yells and tells me to calm down and just gets angrier when I tell him to say sorry for hurting me, i have a good relationship with weed, i smoke it every day at least 2 grams a day and up to 10 grams in a 6 hour long session on binges, i love weed, without it I couldn't cope with this pure denial and lack of responsibility from my dad for accidentally hurting me. My dad is normally not like this, we have arguments rarely maybe once a month but never before has anyone been so ignorant of the consequences of his actions,  which there were none. Other than me being scarred because I experienced it high and me being completely jaw droppingly stunned at my dads actions and coldness.

How can I make sure my speed isn’t meth?,"Hi all. I regularly purchase amphetamine sulphate from this one guy and it’s always pretty consistent.

Should I be proud? Drugs 💊,I am a 23 year old that loves drugs but not more than Jesus. It is amazing that Jesus Christ THEEE JMAN would put certain drugs here ON THIS PLANET. Like if I had a choice I wish they never existed tbh but man are they fun lol.  😆. I feel bad for being proud not letting drugs take over my life (hard drugs ECT.) . No virtual karma points needed. Basically I want to do drugs but as a Catholic Christian I feel shameful when using recreationally even tho I know it's only a sin if addicted. I wish everybody a blessed life and prosperity. Just wanted to say drugs and God are amazing and at the same time if you are struggling with God or drugs it is OK! JMAN and I will support your journey EVERY time when you fall down and get back up. I love everyone NO MATTER WHAT! That is what Jesus wants so I will love everyone unconditionally addict or not!

"How to survive my holiday without oxycontin withdrawls, I need your help guys","Hello friends, I have a question. I’ve been a chronic pain patient for a long time and depend on the pain medication Oxycodone, usually between 300 and 400 milligrams a day. However, I’m traveling to Thailand with my wife for two weeks, and I have no way to take this medication with me. Therefore, I need an alternative to get through these two weeks as smoothly as possible without experiencing withdrawal symptoms. 

I was thinking about either getting Lyrica (Pregabalin) from a pharmacy there to ease the withdrawal symptoms or obtaining Kratom. Various other benzodiazepines, such as Xanax or Valium, are also available at pharmacies there, which I could also consider. Does anyone here have experience with this topic and could give me advice on how to make these two weeks as manageable as possible?

About three or four years ago, I was in Thailand once before. Back then, I was only taking the pain medication Tilidine, although in high doses of 1200 to 1600 milligrams per day. During that vacation, however, I didn’t experience any withdrawal symptoms—none at all, absolutely nothing. I was so worried about that trip, but when I arrived, I didn’t have any withdrawal problems whatsoever. I didn’t feel anything at all. I had a bit of a runny nose for one or two days, but that was it. 

Now I’m wondering if this might still be the case with my current Oxycodone dosage.

How whould you guys manage this ? 
I also think about get some subutex to survive this Holiday.

Best substance before work?,"So I have work today I start at half 3 till 9 so a short one but with it been a Friday were gonna be hella busy lik non stop orders and the shift leader is awful. 
So I was thinking about 2 main options, first of all caffeine.

Which is more than double the amount for a day but I don't care about that.

My next option is vodka. I have basically a full bottle and can handle 10 shots. We'll I'd be very drunk from 10 but still able to do tasks, so I was thinking maybe 6 or 7 just to feel tipsy but not enough to be dizzy and over emotional etc just enough to feel it a decent amount.

I do have weed but I don't think I could trust myself with that lol.

"So I was wondering, if methamphetamine can cause any sort of analgesia??","So long story short, I got high a couple hours ago and just went into the bathroom and was cleaning my ears out with a Q-tip. I pushed way too far in on accident and I’m 90% sure that I burst my eardrum. It hurt like hell for like one second and then the pain just went away, so I’m wondering if it’s because I’m high and the meth is providing some form of analgesia(I had read on a website that methamphetamine can cause analgesia that is even greater than some opiates. I think they said hydrocodone in the example) again I don’t know if that’s true. I might be making that up. I don’t know, but I am concerned about why I’m not feeling a fuck ton of pain in my ear I’m hoping that it was just a really small puncture.

How I found faith through drugs,"This is a bit out there but here goes...

Someone once asked me what changed and made me start believing in God. I have developed this response over time to add value for future readers, in the hope that it interests others, humours them, or helps them on their own journey:

A lifetime of growth and development led me to the point, always wondering what was out there and where did we come from etc. but it all kicked off when I started doing psychedelics 5-ish years ago I think, my mind connected to the spiritual world and I could see so much more than ever before. It really expanded my consciousness. I was enlightened. Boom.

Honestly my brain on psychedelics is so powerful, unlike most I think, I really go places and have an incredibly intricate perspective on things, an infinite number of perspectives if I’m honest. A man of many perspectives I often call myself! I have a powerful ability to see things from many different ways. My mind powers up like a nuclear reactor about to explode (and it almost did once, my first and only ever “bad trip”, I thought I was done, mind snapped. Bad batch, not again).

I have this powerful ability to suspend some thoughts, while I gather other thoughts, in order to put each of the thoughts together as one and build something in my mind. Whereas most people seem to have rolling thoughts, and act on the thought at the tip of their mind, I can suspend some thoughts here and there, and then bring them all together to build something greater.

5-ish years of seeing so many connections and understanding this world like never before, then it all culminated early this year when I saw too many signs to ignore. The nail in the coffin was walking into my sisters after not seeing them for 2 years and a toddler put a child’s version of the bible in my hand. Boom.

The next day I had affirmation from God, driving down the Portway which I’d seen a thousand times before, but this time everything looked so divine. Everything stood taller, wider, bolder, had a magical glow to it. It was God thanking me for finding faith. It lasted weeks, the world looked completely different. It was a holy place. Buildings looked holy, nature looked holy, everything looked so holy!! You should have been there.

No one will fully understand what happened in my mind like me. After that I felt so much love and connection for my fellow humans, started helping people wherever I could, strangers etc. and of course my family and friends. It has led me to be this beautiful wholesome person I am now that likes to spread love and positivity across the world, doing nice things and sacrificing a lot of my own stuff to help build each other up and create a better world!

I am a child of God, doing my service while making the most of life and having a bonkers time while I’m at it.

Forever grateful for this beautiful gift of life!!",0,2,2025-01-24 11:15:00,found faith drugs bit goes ... someone asked changed made start believing god developed response time add value future readers hope interests others humours helps journey lifetime growth development led point always wondering come etc kicked started psychedelics 5-ish years ago think mind connected spiritual world could see much ever really expanded consciousness enlightened boom honestly brain psychedelics powerful unlike think really go places incredibly intricate perspective things infinite number perspectives ’ honest man many perspectives often call powerful ability see things many different ways mind powers like nuclear reactor explode almost first ever “ bad trip ” thought done mind snapped bad batch powerful ability suspend thoughts gather thoughts order put thoughts together one build something mind whereas people seem rolling thoughts act thought tip mind suspend thoughts bring together build something greater 5-ish years seeing many connections understanding world like never culminated early year saw many signs ignore nail coffin walking sisters seeing 2 years toddler put child ’ version bible hand boom next day affirmation god driving portway ’ seen thousand times time everything looked divine everything stood taller wider bolder magical glow god thanking finding faith lasted weeks world looked completely different holy place buildings looked holy nature looked holy everything looked holy one fully understand happened mind like felt much love connection fellow humans started helping people wherever could strangers etc course family friends led beautiful wholesome person likes spread love positivity across world nice things sacrificing lot stuff help build create better world child god service making life bonkers time ’ forever grateful beautiful gift life

"Help, I’m addicted to the psycosis that weed makes worse","I’m still aware that something wrong so I don’t think it’s full psycosis, but the pre phase maybe? I’m spending all my money, every second of my free time high on edibles out of my mind. I take bags a day sometimes 100s of mg every day and can’t get out of the loop. Edibles in particular, not dab or smoking weed is what I’m addicted to, because every time I take a high enough dose i “cross over” and suddenly when I was high from 100mg before and strongly feeling it’s effects. When I take 200mg, I feel sober, I’m still more fucked it then before, but also just feel sober making me take twice as much in a short time trying to get more high and then getting more delusional, it’s gotten to the point where the very few times I can take one day off the edibles, I am still paranoid, but lucid enough to realize the day before when I was high out of my mind I was thinking delusional crazy stuff. I’m in a breif moment of clarity and want out bad, I can’t take it anymore. But the cravings are worse than Nicotine, or anything ive been addicted to. It feels like knifes jabbing into me and I’ve tried replacing it with so many other drugs and either getting addicted for awhile or it doesn’t work because. What I’m addicted to isnt the high, but I think the psycosis part of it. I lose the trippy delusions i have and fully believing it, but it’s also destroying my life. The drug doesnt been make me feel good from the amount I’m doing but I can’t lower it because I crave crossing over and getting delusional so bad.  It’s gotten to the point, even if I’m not fully delusional in the moment like now. I’m hiding in the corner facing away from all windows, and walls and think people are watching or just in case. I don’t feel safe anywhere even in the bathroom, I feel like I have to out a face up everywhere. And when I’m in the edibles it’s even worse because I believe it in the moment.

"Boyfriend secretly uses opioids, I found out. What to do?","Hi everyone, this isn’t my usual scene or sub, but I’m here seeking advice. I don’t know what to do or what to believe anymore.

My boyfriend is a former addict who quit drugs (primarily opioids, which he used daily) cold turkey 7–8 years ago, enduring all the horrible withdrawal symptoms. He claimed not to have touched anything since.  
For the past few months, I’ve had a feeling that something was off, and I asked him a few times if he had started using again. He denied it every time. However, yesterday, I found undeniable proof that he’s been using opioids again (and possibly benzos, weed, and ketamine). He admitted to it.

The general narrative about people hiding their use or addiction is that they ***will*** lie repeatedly to cover it up. My trust in him is completely shattered. Drugs are something I’ve never been around—my closest experience is being asked by the random neighborhood dealer if I wanted weed. I’ve always been wary and cautious around people with a history of drug use or abuse, since this is what society tells us. Should I challenge this believe or it is so strong for a reason?

Drug use is a dealbreaker for me, especially since he lied to me about it. But does it have to be? Do people who use or abuse drugs always lie? Is this always tied to an underlying serious mental health issue?

Please share your thoughts... this feels surreal ",39,76,2025-01-23 10:34:27,boyfriend secretly uses opioids found hi everyone ’ usual scene sub ’ seeking advice ’ know believe anymore boyfriend former addict quit drugs primarily opioids used daily cold turkey 7–8 years ago enduring horrible withdrawal symptoms claimed touched anything since past months ’ feeling something asked times started using denied every time however yesterday found undeniable proof ’ using opioids possibly benzos weed ketamine admitted general narrative people hiding use addiction lie repeatedly cover trust completely shattered drugs something ’ never around—my closest experience asked random neighborhood dealer wanted weed ’ always wary cautious around people history drug use abuse since society tells us challenge believe strong reason drug use dealbreaker especially since lied people use abuse drugs always lie always tied underlying serious mental health issue please share thoughts ... feels surreal

Recently though I’ve noticed that when I take it consistently for too long a few things happen. first of all I usually wake up at like 3-5 AM and have a hard time going back to sleep which I’m assuming is probably when it’s wearing off? second when I wake up I almost feel like I have a hangover?? My mouth is SO dry & I have a headache. It’s kinda concerning me so just wondering if anyone knows why this is happening?? And then second question— I am prescribed Vyvanse for my ADHD which I am assuming is prob part of the problem (tho i don’t take it every day and still have bad insomnia when i don’t take it) I really want to figure out if there’s a (healthy & sustainable) solution for the insomnia without having to give up the vyvanse bc it truly has done wonders to improve the issues my ADHD was causing.

"My experience with SEVERE sleep deprivation GHB dependance/addiction, withdrawal and quitting.","TLDR: G caused the worst insomnia of my life, the worst anxiety due to withdrawal and lack of sleep, putting myself in dangerous situations, gaining weight because it makes you very hungry, quitting exercise because I was constantly exhausted even when I was on it, almost went into psychosis and came close to seizures. My guy ran out frequently which is why I went through withdrawals so many times and wasn't able to taper correctly.

I'll preface this by saying this: If you've never taken GHB GOOD. PLEASE DON'T START. It is incredibly addictive. If you decide to get it, and for some reason run out or miss a dose before bed time you will not sleep. With consistent use you probably won't sleep for days... at least 7 days of no sleep unless you use assuming you've been using for at least 3-5 weeks on a moderately consistent basis. 

\[Important Info\]

All that I have learned about 1,4-BDO is from reputable sites such as erowid, psychonaut wiki, the public data not the trip reports. I have withdrawn from many things, alcohol, xanax, fentanyl, heroin, etc. GHB withdrawal was BY FAR the worst due to the brutal insomnia. Technically I used 1,4-BDO which is slightly less potent than GHB and takes longer to kick in but lasts much longer. Tolerance develops very very quickly and the “magic” and euphoria goes away. Even at peak the best you feel if you're dependant 24/7 user is anxiety reduction and tiredness . If you don’t taper off you’re at risk of psychosis or/and death by seizure.

\[Background\]

For the last 3 months I have been struggling with addiction... while in rehab. I am drug tested and breathalyzed once a week and for the first month I was completely sober. And it was during this time that I fantasized about getting GHB. I had done it in the past numerous times but somehow always managed to not develop a tolerance, it didn't even affect my sleep negatively. Probably because at the time I was drinking, and doing various other drugs regularly such as Xanax so I wasn't getting my high from only one drug. The first month of using G was amazing. I slept so well, fell asleep almost instantly, had insanely good workout, was incredibly social and driven to talk to women, very social with my friends, constantly had minimal or no anxiety so became very charismatic and driven. Of course, this never lasts.

\[STORY pt. 1\]

For the first month of using 1,4-BDO (which converts to GHB) I didn’t have too many problems probably due to not having a tolerance. If I decided I wanted to sleep and hadn’t used any G in like 7 or 8 hours I could sleep no problem. Then I ran out for like 2 days and it wasn’t too bad, three days of no sleep wasn’t fun though. Then I began using 24/7 because even though 1,4 lasts longer than G it’s still only mostly noticeable for like 2 hours after that you just feel sleepy or rebound with your glutamate and GABA firing nonstop and creating a huge energy surge it’s almost impossible to stop talking, makes you seem like you’re on something. After 2 weeks of non-stop using around 20-35ml (mind you, just to feel normal that's about 2ml every hour and 5ml twice nightly. My personal experience: For BDO NOT GHB 1 or 2ml won’t make me sleep, 3ml will help sleep for 2 hours but you have to try to sleep and it’s easy to stay awake. 3ml = 3 hours of sleep. 4ml 3.50 hours of sleep. 5ml = 4 hours of sleep. 6ml 4 hours of deep sleep. 7ml&8ml = 4 hours (almost exactly) of deep sleep. DO NOT ATTEMPT THESE NUMBERS THEY ARE ASSUMING YOU HAVE A VERY HIGH TOLERANCE.   

\[STORY pt.2\]

My upcoming times where I ran out continued to get worse and worse. I am now 7 days sober and finally slept for the first time last night. Bad things happened when I was addicted. I almost got arrested for public intoxication and EMTs almost narcanned me because I fell asleep on the side of the road. Almost went into full psychosis when I took buproprion (which I am prescribed 2x a day) on day 2 of withdrawals. Suffered through so many sleepless nights while my roommate and housemates slept peacefully, I was so jealous. There is no jealousy like the jealousy for sleep when your brain chemicals are so messed up you cannot get even two minutes of sleep. I had read on Reddit that people who used even more than me only had insomnia for 3 days, not the case. That's why I think this is so important to help others be aware of, I would never wish this upon my worst enemy. For anyone who needs support, message me or comment.

For a while I tried to use it only for sleep, which made the withdrawals less intense when I eventually ran out by they were still there. And I was unable to sleep for days afterwards.

I have 300ml stashed which I plan on either throwing out or just never going to retrieve. I prayed for sobriety like I never have while withdrawing from this demon we call GHB. By the grace of God, and Jesus Christ I am finally now sober and able to sleep again. What is preventing me from picking it up and using it? I sleep just fine without G so to get G for sleep just harms my future self and at some point when I run out I will go into withdrawal. If I were to get it for the amazing high I know I would be using it every day because the cravings are so intense. It pulls me further from God. 

* Withdrawal Symptoms:
   * Insomnia: One of the most common withdrawal symptoms is difficulty sleeping.
   * Anxiety and Restlessness: These can also contribute to sleep disturbances.
   * Fatigue and Irritability: These symptoms can make it challenging to get restful sleep.
* Duration of Withdrawal:
   * Acute Withdrawal: The initial withdrawal phase can last several days to a week. During this time, you may experience the most severe symptoms, including insomnia.
   * Protracted Withdrawal: Some people may experience prolonged withdrawal symptoms, which can last for several weeks or even months. These symptoms are usually milder but can still affect sleep",1,4,2025-01-24 03:50:49,"experience severe sleep deprivation ghb dependance/addiction withdrawal quitting tldr g caused worst insomnia life worst anxiety due withdrawal lack sleep putting dangerous situations gaining weight makes hungry quitting exercise constantly exhausted even almost went psychosis came close seizures guy ran frequently went withdrawals many times n't able taper correctly 'll preface saying 've never taken ghb good please n't start incredibly addictive decide get reason run miss dose bed time sleep consistent use probably wo n't sleep days ... least 7 days sleep unless use assuming 've using least 3-5 weeks moderately consistent basis important info\ learned 1,4-bdo reputable sites erowid psychonaut wiki public data trip reports withdrawn many things alcohol xanax fentanyl heroin etc ghb withdrawal far worst due brutal insomnia technically used 1,4-bdo slightly less potent ghb takes longer kick lasts much longer tolerance develops quickly “ magic ” euphoria goes away even peak best feel 're dependant 24/7 user anxiety reduction tiredness ’ taper ’ risk psychosis or/and death seizure background\ last 3 months struggling addiction ... rehab drug tested breathalyzed week first month completely sober time fantasized getting ghb done past numerous times somehow always managed develop tolerance n't even affect sleep negatively probably time drinking various drugs regularly xanax n't getting high one drug first month using g amazing slept well fell asleep almost instantly insanely good workout incredibly social driven talk women social friends constantly minimal anxiety became charismatic driven course never lasts story pt 1\ first month using 1,4-bdo converts ghb ’ many problems probably due tolerance decided wanted sleep ’ used g like 7 8 hours could sleep problem ran like 2 days ’ bad three days sleep ’ fun though began using 24/7 even though 1,4 lasts longer g ’ still mostly noticeable like 2 hours feel sleepy rebound glutamate gaba firing nonstop creating huge energy surge ’ almost impossible stop talking makes seem like ’ something 2 weeks non-stop using around 20-35ml mind feel normal 's 2ml every hour 5ml twice nightly personal experience bdo ghb 1 2ml ’ make sleep 3ml help sleep 2 hours try sleep ’ easy stay awake 3ml 3 hours sleep 4ml 3.50 hours sleep 5ml 4 hours sleep 6ml 4 hours deep sleep 7ml 8ml 4 hours almost exactly deep sleep attempt numbers assuming high tolerance story pt.2\ upcoming times ran continued get worse worse 7 days sober finally slept first time last night bad things happened addicted almost got arrested public intoxication emts almost narcanned fell asleep side road almost went full psychosis took buproprion prescribed 2x day day 2 withdrawals suffered many sleepless nights roommate housemates slept peacefully jealous jealousy like jealousy sleep brain chemicals messed get even two minutes sleep read reddit people used even insomnia 3 days case 's think important help others aware would never wish upon worst enemy anyone needs support message comment tried use sleep made withdrawals less intense eventually ran still unable sleep days afterwards 300ml stashed plan either throwing never going retrieve prayed sobriety like never withdrawing demon call ghb grace god jesus christ finally sober able sleep preventing picking using sleep fine without g get g sleep harms future self point run go withdrawal get amazing high know would using every day cravings intense pulls god withdrawal symptoms insomnia one common withdrawal symptoms difficulty sleeping anxiety restlessness also contribute sleep disturbances fatigue irritability symptoms make challenging get restful sleep duration withdrawal acute withdrawal initial withdrawal phase last several days week time may experience severe symptoms including insomnia protracted withdrawal people may experience prolonged withdrawal symptoms last several weeks even months symptoms usually milder still affect sleep"

Encounters with Shadow People,"
I used to do a lot of meth. I don't anymore. One of the things I really liked about meth was the hallucinations I got around night 3 of sleep deprivation. My favorite ones to see were the Shadow People. Here are a few stories about me and my psychosis-induced friends.

1. I opened the door to my apartment and saw a person move towards me. The doorway to my apartment was shadowy. No one should've been in my apartment. I was very high on meth.

This person was a little shorter than me and looked like tinkerbell, but 5'6. This was my first Shadow Person, so I was terrified for a few seconds. Her figure looked like it was composed out of trillion tiny dark particles. No shadow person had distinguishing features outside of their form - she was no different. The only thing that distinguished the shadow people from one another was their form and height.

She did a little dance as a kind of greeting and walked to where a ray of sunshine hit the door. She dissolved in the light. This was my first autonomous hallucination and I was excited. The SP seemed friendly, so I tried to bring her back from the shadows but she was gone. 

2. Most of my hallucinations were auditory. I would hear the voice of friends or family from outside my room or sometimes outside my apartment down the hall. This one time I was going to bed, a bar of flualprazolam in my pocket. That was the only shit that worked to stop a meth binge in its tracks. A quarter bar could cause a blackout. Anyways.

I hear my girlfriend's voice from the living room. It's dark and empty. I had meant to furnish the room but all extra money went to drugs. Big empty dark room that definitely didn't have my girlfriend hanging in it. She was in the process of leaving me because meth made me into a fairly bad partner. She hated being around me when I was spun.

I head down the hall to the room. I know I'm about to hallucinate something and so try to will my girlfriend to show up as a shadow person. Despite appearing automonous, I always considered them as just hallucinations. I figured I could have a say in what I saw. I hoped to see her shadow figure in the room. It was her voice after all that I heard.

I didn't turn on all the lights as a SP needs darkness to manifest. I let a bit of kitchen light leak into the room, leaving the shadowy parts even darker. And in those shadowy corners came forward a large, rotund man. Kinda like Wario. 

We walked towards each other and then circled one another. We were either gonna start fighting or dancing. Meth never made me sex-crazed (it usually killed my libido) and so making love was out of the question. The more we circled, the more scared I got, and so I backed up and out of the room.

What followed was a large spider. It was my height. It moved in a mechanical, janky manner. It didn't look like it would attack but it made me nervous. I let it crawl a bit forward, then watched as it morphed into a doglike creature. Grotesque but non-threatening.

I bit a corner off my benzo bar and decided I'd had enough with the shadow creatures.

3. Not a shadow person, but one night I noticed an Ewok-like creature standing behind my radiator. My friend said it was a spirit. Idk about that but it looked like a giant teddy bear. Whenever I got near it, it would recede into the wall. Totally bonkers.

Anyways, I was lucky that most of my meth psychosis moments were fairly benign. The worst was the paranoia. I miss my shadowy friends, no psychedelic has produced the insane hallucinations that meth and sleep deprivation produced.

The magic of oxycodon,"
It was one of the most wonderful feelings, so euphoric but also cozy and warm. But lately, it just makes me very productive, which is also nice. I can easily tackle the tasks I used to dread with a few pills, but I miss that true, amazing feeling. Even if I take a fairly large dose after a few weeks going without oxycodon, that beautiful ""Christmas by the fireplace with your family and best friends, while your favorite song is playing on the radio, and you've just unwrapped your most beautiful gift under the tree, lying there cuddling with the love of your life on a bear rug right in front of the fire"" feeling doesn’t come back.

"got a few OC40s, am i setting myself up for addiction?","i used opiates in the past during cancer treatment and i would get 10-15mg of hydrocodone and it would have me in a great place. i usually took the prescribed dose or just one extra pill. i had no issues stopping use when doctors took away my access, and haven’t had them for years. i only get access to them when a friend has surgery now. 

recently i had an opportunity and impulsively bought five OC 40 pills from a friend. this is a lot of oxy for someone with my tolerance, and im planning to cut the pills in quarters to get a dose that should be good for me to enjoy. this would give me around 20 doses of oxy. i am wondering if i am running a big risk of addiction here if i try using it like this. i have no access to more for the foreseeable future and the plan is to not buy more. 

i dont have too much experience with opiates, i mostly just smoke weed and occasionally use benzos/lyrica, and ketamine. i have been looking for opiates recently just because i miss them and i am not getting the relief i want with klonopins right now. please advise if it sounds like this is a bad plan to fuck up my life, im 22 and dont want a major addiction before i start working. just hoping to use them for a bit and stop like i did back during my cancer treatment.

i need some help idk what to do,"Ok, so to start from the beginning I tried acid for the first time 2 weeks ago I took 1 tab and since my dumbass didn't feel it after 2h I decided to get smoke a lot right (like I got way too fried).  And the trip itself I would say went well, but I did get scared when it hit me all at once since I wasn't expecting it. Now ever since the trip if I smoke I still see the LSD graphics and shit starts to like warp, so every time I smoke weed it feels like an acid trip, a much smaller one but still one. I now have been sober for around 1 week and if I unfocus enough I can still see the graphics in the background like uk how It's like looking through a kaleidoscope filter well if I unfocus I can see them a bit like bit faded out uk

Idk 

Not complaining btw, definitely my favorite part about meth is not having the ups and downs that came with popping an addy 3x a day when I was prescribed.

Experience with MDMA as a 45 yo,"So, late 40's. Never done anything too extreme. High on weed a few times, more enjoyed getting drunk with alcohol. However, was always interested in the supposed effects of ecstacy(mdma). So; the opportunity came one time with a new mate who had friends who were into all that shit. He went home early knowing I would be exposed to opportunities. So, that happens, just me and one other guy with a noob who's asking about shit. He shares half a pill - no idea what it was. Honestly, can't remember effects exactly. We ended up in a casino then back at his. I insisted he give me some stuff to take back and he gave me a couple of pills. 

So fast forward a week or two. A few people away together, drinking. having fun. I decide to take one of these pills myself later on in the night. I do, I quickly have to lie down. Not because I'm sick but because I'm rapturous/ecstatic  - these are the correct words. I just lay down and happily happily accepted my fate. Eventually I fall asleep after an overdose of happiness/contentment. Boring, I know, standard story ...all true though.

Fast forward a month or two. Research my own supply route. Find one, seems real good quality. Try it, all it does is make me fidgety, weird feeling. I remember arguing with myself it's still better than sober....WHAT? Maybe, but 100 miles away from that feeling of sleeping with God felt bro. Then I get worried. Research, you have to let seratonin levels reset etc. 

Okay, we try that. I'm not disciplined because I can't wait the 3 months it recommends to replenish your serotonin supply so whenever I experiment I'm stuck with a feeling that is so nearly a 100% removed from my initial experience. And I've tried enough dealers by this point to be convinced that I just didn't get unlucky with my initial experience or got unlucky thereafter. There is truth behind the pov that you need to wait 3-6 months to replenish serotonin lvls as far as I understand. The one time I waited 6 months I had the biggest disappointment of all time. I'm not sure how to interpret it. Either my first experience used different drugs or the effect of using it once is so crazy it ruins every time after that forever. I don't know the answer. Just my own personal experience which won't match anyone's here anyway. 

I'm back to again having a 5 month immunity., but I waited 6 month before and that was a wasted fucking effort. I fear I'm just looking at disappointment/ It's so annoying because everything I tried to research and follow promised me all that serotonin shit resets after 90 days. All seems lies.

Was this seizure benzo related?,"I have been using this rc avizafone (a prodrug for Valium). I have never been a long term benzo user but when I do use it tend to use pretty heavy doses. I’d do at most 3 days with blackout level doses then I’d lay off. There was one day where I just said fuck it and took 300mg. Then stopped. Nothing happened.

Anyway after about 10 days from that whopping 300mg dose I had an unprovoked seizure for the first time ever.

There was no anxiety, shakes, hallucinations, and I slept like a baby that night and the previous nights. No other symptoms of benzo withdrawal. 

My question is do you think that seizure had something to do with the benzos? I always imagined benzo seizures are usually preceded and followed by the appearance of other less serious symptoms of withdrawal, like anxiety or insomnia or shaking. I had none of this, just a seizure and nothing more. I actually felt pretty good and sharp afterwards.

I only suspect it might be related as 10 days is about how long it takes for valium to completely leave the body (5 half lives), and so the timeline lines up.

Anyone experienced with benzo withdrawal and especially Valium and seizures please shed some light on this.

I can’t stop thinking about wanting to shoot up,"F19

I use drugs occasionally; I smoke J a couple of times a week or even just a couple of times a month, and I take opioids every few months.

Now I know how to manage substances and use them only on special occasions, but a couple of years ago, when I was deeply struggling with my depression, I abused alcohol and benzos a lot (my go-to benzodiazepine was Rivotril/clonazepam).

I used to take up to 50 drops of clonazepam, and there were times when I mixed it with alcohol to not feel the void (I was also really young back then, 16/17 years old). It always ended with me having breakdowns, crying fits, and episodes of agitation.
For various reasons, I had to stop. I quit cold turkey and went through withdrawal that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.

A month ago, I had an orthopedic surgery, and it was a nightmare. During the pre-admission, I had arranged with the anesthesiologist to go with general anesthesia instead of a spinal block. But once I was in the operating room, the anesthesiologist there told me she wouldn’t do the general and insisted on the spinal. I tried to tell her to stick to the protocol and give me propofol and morphine, but she refused, and I ended up agreeing just to avoid causing more trouble.

Before inserting the needle into my back, I asked her to give me something so I wouldn’t feel a fucking needle in my spine. She said she was going to give me midazolam. I tried to subtly warn her that I had a high tolerance to benzodiazepines since I used to take them, but this stubborn b didn’t even listen and went ahead and injected the midazolam intravenously.

Those 30 seconds when it hit me were incredible. It was an immediate, deep hug that reached every corner of my body. I can’t stop thinking about how amazing that sensation was, and I want so badly to experience it again.

Unfortunately, once I was in the operating room, I started having a panic attack. I was agitated and crying because my brain is still wired to that kind of stimulus (and bc I was scared of the operation). It brought me back to when I was 16, at the lowest point of my life and addiction. What pissed me off the most was that this piece-of-shit anesthesiologist was super annoyed at me for having a panic attack. Like, btch stfu, I tried to explain that I had a high tolerance. And honestly, isn’t it logical? In my country, you need to pass a super tough logic test to get into med school, and yet you can’t do basic math? If a 18 yo knows the names of all the drugs (like when I suggested propofol and morphine or immediately recognized midazolam as a benzo) and tells you she has a high tolerance, doesn’t that imply she’s abuse them before or know what drugs are?

The fact remains that aside from the distress, I desperately want to try intravenous midazolam again. I could even get it through a contact, but I’m scared I’d end up doing something I’d regret forever. Still, that sensation filled every void in me. Shooting up feels like one of the closest things to paradise.",2,3,2025-01-23 18:53:55,’ stop thinking wanting shoot f19 use drugs occasionally smoke j couple times week even couple times month take opioids every months know manage substances use special occasions couple years ago deeply struggling depression abused alcohol benzos lot go-to benzodiazepine rivotril/clonazepam used take 50 drops clonazepam times mixed alcohol feel void also really young back 16/17 years old always ended breakdowns crying fits episodes agitation various reasons stop quit cold turkey went withdrawal ’ wish worst enemy month ago orthopedic surgery nightmare pre-admission arranged anesthesiologist go general anesthesia instead spinal block operating room anesthesiologist told ’ general insisted spinal tried tell stick protocol give propofol morphine refused ended agreeing avoid causing trouble inserting needle back asked give something ’ feel fucking needle spine said going give midazolam tried subtly warn high tolerance benzodiazepines since used take stubborn b ’ even listen went ahead injected midazolam intravenously 30 seconds hit incredible immediate deep hug reached every corner body ’ stop thinking amazing sensation want badly experience unfortunately operating room started panic attack agitated crying brain still wired kind stimulus bc scared operation brought back 16 lowest point life addiction pissed piece-of-shit anesthesiologist super annoyed panic attack like btch stfu tried explain high tolerance honestly ’ logical country need pass super tough logic test get med school yet ’ basic math 18 yo knows names drugs like suggested propofol morphine immediately recognized midazolam benzo tells high tolerance ’ imply ’ abuse know drugs fact remains aside distress desperately want try intravenous midazolam could even get contact ’ scared ’ end something ’ regret forever still sensation filled every void shooting feels like one closest things paradise
the triple M... mushrooms meth molly,"i've been wanting to write about this experience for a while. this was the last week of october 2024, i was home tryna get sober but my dealer was hitting me up w some special fucking deals. i ended up getting 5g penis envy shrooms, an 🎱 of meth, and i think 500mg molly? anyways thursday night i decided to take about 3g of the shrooms. started seeing devil trees and hearing deep devil voices outside my window, then saw my parents with my dog on the balcony sweeping a searchlight through my room. i stumbled into the room next to mine where the balcony leads out and TALKED TO THEM for probably 3 minutes. i was super high had smoked a couple joints as well and eventually left and just passed out on my bed. next morning both parents claim they were never up on the balcony and start thinking im crazy. im hearing this one song all day and i become convinced its playing on the radio??? i also start seeing faces in my medical textbooks. 

that night its friday night so im free the next morning, so i take probably 2 gs of meth straight to the dome. im fucking tweaking at this point and i steal fireball from my parents wine cellar and drink some of that too. im super wired, its my first time trying meth and im falling dangerously in love w it. i stay up the entire night, thankfully dont take anymore, and obsessively hide and rehide my stash in different parts of my room. 

that night (so early saturday morning now) at 5 fucking am i take god knows how much molly. i have therapy that same day at 10 am and a tutoring session at 2 pm so im freaked out at this point, i havent eaten in a day and have been ignoring the fact im tweaking off drugs the entire time and just tryna live my life like normal. im drinking more fireball and i go to therapy pretty high, hoping she doesnt notice my pupils dilated to shit off the molly. i go home and i can hear my mother's voice constantly, i become convinced there are cameras and microphones set up around my house to catch me doing drugs or doing anything at all. get super paranoid and start responding to her voice out loud, which really freaks my family out but i had no idea her voice wasnt real at this point. it all felt so so real. 

before my tutoring session i confess all the recent drugs to her bc im convinced she already has camera footage. she obviously didnt know and got super upset, i had to confess to my dad too which ended in a thorough search of my room (and yes discovery of my hiding stash). at this point im seeing actual cameras in the ceiling, telescoping towards me and in dark rooms with flashlights to illuminate my face. i go sleep in my parents room and hallucinate all through the night, although at this point i STILL think its real, seeing doctors and my parents coming into and out of the room. i dont sleep at all and i physically cant close my eyes bc they keep shaking back and forth, im sweating up a storm and shaking from how cold i am all at the same time. im super delirious and hear my moms voice commenting on my every move for the next 3-4 days which is insane to my mental. in other rooms like my own room, my brothers room, i still saw telescoping cameras and i believed they were there for a really long time until i learned more about drug induced psychosis and started to believe what my parents were saying a little more again

my 2 year old lsd trip report,"just found my trip report of my 2nd (and most recent) use of lsd from 2 years ago, thought some might wanna ganda at it 

lsd trip report 3/6/23

me ollie and bobby decided to take lsd at bobbys house on saturday night, i went to see my girlfriend why the other 2 picked up the lsd. when we got back to Bobbys house we unrapped the foil and saw there was 6 tabs instead of the intended 2. we waited until 11 and dropped a tab each. me and ollie the first to feel the effects after 30-40 minutes but bobby got impatient and dropped another tab. 

before i put the tab in i was feeling anxious and my heart was starting to beat fast, which confused me as i had already done lsd before. i decided to take it after about 15 minutes of waiting for the anxiety to go. the tab had a bitter taste to it which i knew meant i had to spit it out but i stupidly kept it in and calmed down. 

when the effects kicked in i was trying to look at as many things as possible, i started by looking closely at a pillow and a blanket while shining my phone torch on them, i saw the cotton moving around and making patterns, i tried to use my phone. my keyboard as well as nearly everything on it was moving around. 

the next 1-3 hours was a blur to me, all three of us were having a good time exploring the trip and joking around. bobbys 2nd tab had kicked in and the first noticeable thing that happened was bobby was seeing his lamp shade as a portal, soon after that he started panicking and said something like ‘omfg finley help me’ 

i didn’t realise at the time he was having a bad lsd trip but ollie did and came on the bed and started talking to him, bobby started asking where we were and who he was with which started to send me into panic, but i remember that when you green out on normal party drugs like weed thc and edibles you can easily think your way out of it so even thought i was on lsd i tried it, it started working but bobby said he felt like he was gonna he sick and i stared getting visions in my head of him throwing up everywhere, bobby was still freaking out so i put my hand on his knee and tried to tell him he’s fine and we’re real, he hit me and said that’s not funny and he started uncontrollably tapping ollie and repeatedly asking him the same questions: where are we, who’s in this room and stuff like that. 

i started to try and calm myself down more but because bobby had hit me in his erratic lsd state i kept getting more violent visions of him lashing out on either me or ollie and attacking us, because of this i decided to focus on calming and distancing myself and ollie was helping bobby.

it was at this moment when i realised that both ollie and bobby were stuck in a loop, they were continuously repeating the same stuff and bobby would lay down for like 30 seconds and sit up and say ‘it’s happening again’ i didn’t try and tell them they were in a loop because i didn’t want to panic or scare them even more. 

the fact that i was aware what was happening with ollie and bobby made me feel better, i started using my vape and tiktok to distract me, the reason i didn’t help them was because in my mind i was thinking this loop had been going on for about 30 minutes and nothing bad had happened to i decided to let them ride it out, i went through hours of listening to the same conversations happen. 

it got to about 4am (none of us had slept) and i started feeling more able (still tripping on acid though) i got up and got us chocolate from downstairs and when i came back ollie and bobby had calmed down and they were watching fast and furious. 

from them on the visual effects wore off for me and the only way i could describe how i felt was drunk, my face felt really slow and heavy and i was talking really slow but i could still think like a normal person.

Week to recover from burnout and quitting opiates,"If you were:

🔘Physically and emotionally exhausted (from stress, illness, trauma, etc.),

🔘Out of “spoons” (no energy or life left in you),
…and had just one week to recover, rest, and reset before returning to an intense schedule (like studying or a busy daily life):

⁉️⁉️⁉️What would you do to recover as much as possible in that week? Where would you be? What activities or strategies would help you the most?

My situation (for context): I have next week off from university but will return to an intense academic load afterward.

I’m dealing with:

🔘Recent medical trauma & burnout,

🔘Chronic illness,

🔘ADHD (medicated) and ASD,

🔘Fresh recovery (few weeks) after 5 years of prescription opiate addiction (my brain is still adjusting to life without it). I’m on 50 mg naltrexone. 

🔘I feel extremely drained: even small tasks, like quick grocery shopping, cause shutdown. After quitting opiates I also feel empty, depressed. 

Academic achievements are my number one priority and I’m aiming for highest grades again, but I’m struggling to find energy or focus.

I know that true recovery takes much longer than a week, and there are no quick fixes. But life doesn’t always allow for extended breaks, so I’m desperate for any tips that might help.

Ketamine analogues vs pcp analogues,"I’m mainly familiar with ketamine and ketamine analogues, like dck, bromo ket, and fxe. Also have a lot of experience with dxm of course. Dissociatives are by far my favorite class of drugs out there. So far my favorite dissociatives are fxe and dxm. 

Was wondering how the pcp analogues compare to the ket ones. I’ve heard there’s more stimulation with the pcp ones. I also have heard that there are more classical psychedelic effects to the pcp analogues.

Pros and cons of each type? & do the pcp analogues have lingering after effects? For me the ketamine side of things doesn’t really leave any type of afterglow like dxm does, which I kind of wish they did because I love the dxm afterglow. I guess that is because dxm increases serotonin while ketamine doesn’t. 

I love the ketamine analogues and ketamine itself of course but was curious about the other dissociatives that are out there.

Was this substance related or something else?,"TL;DR: Took a 'safe for me' combo of phenibut and alcohol, passed out, woke up with severe back pain and a nearly bitten in half tongue.



A few months ago I started using [phenibut](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut) again to try to reduce my alcohol use. Girlfriend was away for a week and I got careless and picked up some rum with which, a few hours before, I had about 1000mg of phenibut. This is a bad move and in the past would've made me puke my guts out combining the two but my tolerance for both is high enough I didn't think much of it.

I drank, felt good, a few hours went by and I was plenty inebriated. Blacking out is incredibly uncommon for me and I can count on one hand how many times that's happened with alcohol. Phenibut is odd, despite being a GABA drug keeps me at ease but slightly stimulated.

At a point I get a type of headache and can't really remember what happened after that. It was late but I was doing things on my laptop and wasn't intending on sleeping anytime soon.

I wake up in a total daze, can't remember how I fell asleep or why. (I know, combing GABA drugs is very dangerous but I hadn't reached any sort of tolerance ceiling as far as I can determine). I felt like I had some sort of short term amnesia-- took me a moment to remember my name and I had a nagging thought there was someone else I was involved with. More extreme than some kind of hangover nap. I sat there for about five minutes until I remembered my girlfriend and her name.

It was about 15 or 30 minutes until I felt totally mentally 'there'.

After an hour I noticed my back hurt like hell and my tongue felt numb. I sat in bed trying to figure out what happened for a couple hours but the back pain grew and my tongue felt weirder and weirder. I hobbled to the bathroom to look at my tongue and noticed my mouth all bloody and a large gash halfway through my tongue. Now even more alarmed, I threw some gauze in my mouth and sat back in bed.

I fell asleep and the next day the back pain was so unbearable I was wincing and out of breath just sitting up on the edge of the bed. It was like this for three or four days, practically bedridden until I got to a point where I was workable (I have a low pain tolerance). For the first couple days the pain felt like it was coming from my kidneys, but later seemed like my spine and for the remainder of the time it hurt.

Took about two weeks for my tongue to heal and about a month and a half for my back to feel normal again.

What's odd to me is that I seemed to have had some kind of acute spasm, but I was loaded up on a muscle relaxer so I'm sort of clueless as to how this could've happened.

Methamphetamine usage causing other drugs to be stronger,"Hi, ive done meth a handful of times in my life. Causing psychosis most times lol but does anyone else feel as though it makes other drugs stronger? From my understanding it is a dopamine agonist... 

After trying meth this last time it subjectively made weed a lot stronger. I mean a LOT stronger. Usually i could smoke a gram or two to the face and not feel much. But this time i faced a 1 gram joint and was stoned out of my mind... also fed my stoner friend a light 25mg edible and he was also super stoned from that, when he would usually have to take upwards of 150mg+ to feel much.

This is also the same way with other stimulants like cocaine but i guess it makes sense considering the psychosis aspect. Although it is noticeably different after methamphetamine usage, even after the drug leaves my body. For reference i am 19 and around 150lb and 6'1 (underweight for my age and height lol)

I don’t feel like anything is working 🙃,"Hi everyone,

I’m new here and wanted to share my experience because I’m trying to figure out what might be going on with me. A little background: I’ve always been pretty clean when it comes to substances—just smoked weed occasionally and drank rarely. My late ex-husband struggled with addiction for most of our relationship, which made me wary of trying anything beyond what I already knew. He also reinforced some negative stigmas, like saying things like “only whores do drugs like Molly,” which stuck with me for years.

When he passed away in November 2023, I decided it was time to reclaim my life and start living for myself. I’ve tried a few things since, and I’d love some insight from others who might have been in my shoes.

	•	Molly (MDMA): I tried it in January 2023 with close friends, and it was incredible. I didn’t know at the time about the interaction between SSRIs (I’ve been on 50 mg Zoloft since September 2023) and Molly, but I still felt amazing and had an afterglow for days. I tried it again later in the year, but the effects were much less intense, which I now realize might be because of the Zoloft.
	•	Coke: I’ve tried it a few times recently (Christmas Eve/Day, Jan 4th, 18th, 19th), but I don’t feel the effects at all. I might get a little chattier or productive, but nothing close to what people describe. I’ve even seen it cut directly from the source, so I doubt it’s a quality issue.
	•	Adderall: I’ve been prescribed 30 mg but never took it before because my late husband would take them all. This year, I started trying it (10 mg in the morning, eventually 20 mg, then 10 mg after lunch), but I don’t feel much difference. Again, I might be a little more productive, but it’s not what others describe.
	•	Xanax: I’ve had a 1 mg prescription since 2019 but rarely take it. Recently, I had a very stressful event and took 1 mg, but it didn’t calm me down. I even tried 2 mg, but it still didn’t help, and I was wide awake at 2 AM.

I’ve had recent bloodwork done, and everything came back great. I’ve also lost 90 pounds since my ex passed (in a healthy way), been saving money, focusing on therapy, and making positive life changes. This week, I’ve decided to take a break from everything—both prescribed and recreational—to reset.

I don’t think it’s a tolerance issue since I’ve never been a heavy or regular user of any substance. Has anyone else experienced this? Could it be the Zoloft, something with my brain chemistry, or maybe just how I’m wired? I’d love to hear your thoughts or advice.

Thanks for reading and for any insight you can share!

Protect the brain from NMDA antagonists without losing the Psychedelic Spiritual effects,"Per [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olney%27s_lesions):

Ketamine’s neurotoxicity (Olney’s lesions) is linked to excessive NMDA receptor blockade, causing excitotoxic glutamate surges. Protective strategies aim to reduce glutamate activity or adrenergic tone, but these may interfere with its psychedelic effects, which are theorized to arise from glutamate-driven neuronal activation.

---

### **Agents That May Reduce Neurotoxicity**

**1. GABA Enhancers**  
- **Supplements/Medications**: L-Theanine (green tea), Valerian Root, Kava* (*caution: liver risks*), Taurine.  
- **Prescription**: Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam), propofol.  
- **Mechanism**: Calm hyperexcitability but may dull dissociation/spiritual effects.  

**2. Glutamate Modulators**  
- **Supplements**: NAC (N-acetylcysteine), Magnesium (glycinate/threonate), Agmatine, Taurine, Vinpocetine, ALCAR, Creatine.  
- **Mechanism**: Antioxidant support, NMDA modulation, or glutamate clearance.  

**3. Adrenergic Tone Reducers**  
- **Supplements**: Rhodiola Rosea (mild NE modulation), Omega-3s (anti-inflammatory).  
- **Prescription**: Clonidine, dexmedetomidine (alpha-2 agonists).  

**4. Antioxidants**  
- **Supplements**: Vitamin C, CoQ10, Curcumin, Alpha Lipoic Acid (also has an effect on glutamate clearance).  
- **Mechanism**: Combat oxidative stress from excitotoxicity.  

---

### **Agents That May Worsen Neurotoxicity**  
- **Avoid**: Yohimbine (alpha-2 antagonist), stimulants (caffeine, amphetamines), MDMA, possibly Aniracetam (PAM), modafinil.  

---

### **Speculation**  

GABA inhibition of glutamate seems to have the most blunting effects alongside clonidine and adrenergic tone reduction. These also increase the amnesiac qualities, which may be counterproductive depending on one's goals.  

It is interesting that green tea could be protective via multiple paths, both in EGCG protection of the bladder/kidneys and in L-theanine protection of the brain. L-theanine is less sedating due to its mechanisms than other GABA methods and may interfere less at low doses.  

The most interesting to me is **ALCAR**, which:  
- Reduces brain inflammation.  
- Protects cells via antioxidant activity.  
- Modulates NMDA while increasing energy metabolism (not sedating).  
- Enhances neuroplasticity.  

Secondly, **creatine** both boosts ATP and protects neurons against NMDA excitotoxicity in rodent models without impacting glutamate. NF-κB Pathway Modulation protects neurons despite higher energy.  

Third, strong acute antioxidants like **Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA)** may also be protective without significantly reducing psychedelic effects.

Would you take drugs if the comedown came first?,"Before I quit, I would always wonder why I kept drinking and drugging when it made me feel so awful afterwards.

I came to realise that we are wired to short-term gains. When I felt miserable, angry etc, I would automatically turn to alcohol or drugs for relief, and fu@k ‘future me’, he could deal with the consequences.

But logically, if there is a positive and negative side to using, why does it matter what order it is in?

It would be interesting to, for example, drink alcohol and experience a terrible hangover, giving away to feeling drunk, and then have it suddenly stop.

Would anybody drink/drug if the process was this way round?

"💀 Flakka 0.5g bad trip report, α-PVP (bath sals) and the reason why it is so dangerous and misunderstood","a-PVP acts exactly like cocaine on the brain, affecting dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, with one significant difference: It's 100 times more powerful

Indeed, smoking just 0.001g of a-PVP i t's a light dose and can produce effects similar to snorting 0.1g of cocaine, the danger lies in how easy it is to consume dangerous amounts like 0.1g and above in one go.

Everyone has been curious about what a person feels when they lose their mind and become like a zombie. I found a video on YouTube of someone in Russia who had the misfortune of ingesting his 0.5g bag because the police caught him, and he detailed his ""bad trip"" which was truly spine-chilling. By the way, after this experience, the guy completely stopped using drugs.

Trip Report:  
He ate the bag containing 0.5g inside the police station with the idea of retrieving it in the bathroom, but that didn't happen; obviously, it dissolved while he was still in the station, and he started feeling the first effects there. Fortunately, they released him, and he started walking home. There was quite a distance to cover, and in about an hour, his body absorbed a lethal dose of the zombie drug.

He heard an extremely loud ringing in his ears, probably due to the extreme release of dopamine, but it wasn't pleasant; it was like a missile flying over his brain that was about to explode. At that moment, he realized he was doomed: the bag had melted, and he still had some way to go to reach the safety of his home.

The paranoia began; it seemed to him that everyone around was looking at him, and with each passing second, they were staring more intensely. People's faces became increasingly aggressive, their appearance turning into that of zombies who wanted to kill him. Even the people in cars had their heads turned towards him, and the sound grew increasingly terrifying. It felt like he was in hell, surrounded by people who all wanted to kill him, everyone turned towards him with satanic expressions.

He started experiencing motor difficulties, and despite all the fear he felt, he understood that it was all the effect of the drug. All he had to do was make it home safely and hide in the hope that it would all end. And as one might imagine, all he managed to do was perform the flakka dance.

It should be added that this drug seems easy to produce and is very cheap, making it a weapon of mass destruction.

"GABA’s and tramadol, seizure risk?","Si Im confused about that, some say you should over do GABA's because they increase seizure risks, others say they actually lowers them. My tramadol tolerance has been up and down (as I tend to change my preferred opiate), but it the last month or so I've been abusing the seizure safe zone (400mg) to counteract that, I've been taking (at first 1 mg of klonopin/clonazepam for every 200 mg after the 400mg mark, then I found out I was fine by taking just .5 mg for the same amount), with this combo, I've been able to get to 1g of Tramadol without issues.

Anyways, I ve tried I few times with Gabapentine, I found I'm not very reactive to it so to feel the effects just from it I have to get like 2000-2500 mg of it, and mixed with tramadol, around 1500 mg. When I did that, I got to 600 mg of tramadol (maybe 800 mg, honestly can't relented correctly lol) but got too scared to up my dose even more. Is it safe to gradually up my dose of tramadol if I continue taking Gaba? Like for example, 300 mg pills every 30 minutes after 800mg of Gaba every 200 mg of tramadol after the 400 mg dose?

And aside from it, I've never tried Pregabalin before and I'm thinking of redoing my Tram + Gaba mix but now with lyrica, from what I have read, it's kinda twice as hard as GABA, right? So if I adjust my calculations I will reach the same effects, or is it any riskier with pregabs?

Also, I've been searching a fucking lot and can't find a reasonable risk list of abusing gabaernigcs like the previous I mentioned, when combined, when in solo, I sometimes with Gaba feel I'm not as high as I want to (as all addicts experience lol) and start going crazy with the doses, but haven't found what could happen in that event tho.

My bf is finally clean!,"So I posted on this sub a while ago saying that my bf had relapsed again. Well, as of 9 days ago, he started methadone and is clean off of heroin! 
I'm so unbelievably proud of him. 

I told him after the fact that he acted different on drugs vs off. And he's like really? And I'm like, really. It's a difference that's hard to explain honestly. It's subtle but not subtle at the same time. I feel like some of you may know what I'm talking about. 

We've had many conversations since then and he's just been improving. :) Applying for new jobs, contacting apartment complexes to move out of his current housing situation and been mostly back to his sweet, lovey dovey self. He was mostly sweet on drugs but it was like a shell of himself. He's coming back into who he was before he relapsed and I couldn't be happier. He's happier, his face glows now and all his track marks are healing wonderfully! (He's been keeping a close eye on them since at one point some got infected.) 

I fully believe recovery is possible for anybody that seeks it. If you, or a loved one is ready to take the next step, i highly encourage you to do so. Different things work for different people. Methadone is the route he's chosen to take for now and I'm ok with that. I was a bit apprehensive at first but seeing how much it's helped him has made me let go of some of those fears.

What were my gummies laced with?,"Last year when I was in Paris, I came across a store that caught my eye. It caught my eye because there was flower and pre rolls sitting there in the window. I decided to go inside and I spoke to the lady that worked there. She didn’t speak much English but I asked if they had any edibles, to which she said they had gummies. I decided to buy some, and I remember her telling me something along the lines of “these are very strong so only take one, and you’ll feel it within an hour”. She also claimed that they were delta-8.

I heeded her advice and ate one of the gummies shortly after leaving the store. I then went out sightseeing and I kinda forgot about the gummy I ate until about 2 hours later when I realized I didn’t feel any different at all, so I decided to eat two more. Once again I kinda forgot about it as I went about sightseeing and I felt no noticeable difference. 

However, this changed when I got back to my hotel later that night and I realized I was full on tripping. I had visuals that looked like a continually shifting perspective illusion, similar to the music video of Shadow Moses by Bring Me The Horizon. My imagination was also going ballistic, and mental images kept flooding my brain wildly, barely under my control. 

I felt extremely sluggish and so I decided to go sleep. That night I had the worst, most visceral dream of my entire life, unlike anything I’ve ever had before. When I woke up the next morning, I was barely conscious and I could barely make it to the bathroom. It felt kind of like being extremely hungover, except much worse, like my center of gravity had been shifted. I didn’t have a choice but to stay in the hotel room as all my energy had been sapped from my body. 

The worst part however, was just how long it lasted. The next day I was flying back to the UK where I was living at the time, and I felt as if I was in a dream and nothing around me was real. It’s actually kind of a miracle that I made it through the airport and caught my flight on time. I was expecting to wake up in my bed at any moment to reveal that it had all been a dream. 

I had flashbacks where things seemed unreal and dreamlike for about a week before I felt fully normal again. I can’t stop wondering what could’ve been in those gummies. No drug I’ve ever taken before has produced such disorientating visuals, and nothing has made me feel completely comatose in the aftermath or like I was 100% dreaming. 

I feel like there’s no way that simple delta-8 could’ve produced such extreme effects, so I’m curious to know what you guys think it could’ve been. Thanks in advance.

Quick question about clonidine and abuse of it.,"So i have a fair prediction of how yall will answer this question but i want to ask. 
Does snorting clonidine have ANY recreational effects? even if they are very slight? 
context: some people in my rehab talk about snorting clonidine at 2-4 pills (dose unknown) talk about how it makes you extremely drowsy and just knocked out. ( i know, very reliable, unbiased, scientific, and reputable source lol) and i have seen very mixed answers on reddit. most say that it does nothing and any “downer” effect is either placebo, or just conformation bias blowing having unnaturally low blood pressure way out of realistic proportion. i want to know, if there are any effects to be expected from doing this, how it works? is there any kind of neurotransmitters released or blocked? etc… so if you are going to say it doesn’t do anything you junkie fuck, enjoy passing out and every limb falling asleep every 10 mins, thanks but just keep scrolling. i don’t plan on doing it but if there is some kind of neurological cause for anything psychoactive i may keep it in my cabinet for emergencies. (sober junkie here, basically if i feel i am going to relapse or i cant handle myself, i would rather have safer, less detectable, and less addictive things on standby. 

TLDR: is there any sort of neurological effects from snorting clonidine? if so what is it doing to the brain to cause it?

Woke up tripping without a name covered in blood.,"I made a longer post about this trip but right now I’ll describe some of the things I’m seeing 22-26 hours since injestion: (things disappear im just writing ass I see it) 
Naked man jerking off in the corner, witchy looking tree branch bent into an upside down cords, dead close family member, dead less close friend lying down in bed near my chair, multiple cats brushing up against my leg, my fan had a cop break through the window and stick his hand inside it (spraying blood all over me).

That’s enough describing visuals for now. Bodily everything feels sore or in pain. Could be because I haven’t eaten in 36+ hours straight. I’ve tried to drink a little water to not much result. Is this just what happens when you eat too much lsd? Keep in mind I don’t even remmebr taking lsd not falling asleep. For about the first hour I think of being awake I still hadn’t gathered my own name. 

I have one more question that is worrying. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia for 4 years and always kinda thought the doctors were just tryna make money off me. But in the last few months I’ve started on medication again and am taking vraylar (antipsychotic mood stabilizer). Could this trip have some permanent harms? I’m worried I could think about that moment choosing between my girlfriend and an infant for the rest of my life. It was so so so so real.

I dont understand Xanax,"A year and a half ago I got my hands on a .5mg xan.

After that I couldn’t understand the hype and decided Id done em once now i was done with xans.

Fast forward to six months ago my uncle gave me some liquid xan on a flight (approx 1-1.5mg) this worked great it made me a little loopy then i passed out and slept the whole flight. When I woke up I felt fine and didnt have any after effects.

Then yesterday I did xanax for the third time. I took three .5mg and nothing. The only thing that happened was I got really cold, even though my heat was set to 30C and I was freezing I even ended up having to put two extra blankets on my bed. I thought maybe I was high and just not realizing it so I recorded myself but watching the videos I can confirm I seemed completely normal. I didnt even end up sleeping well and woke up multiple times throughout the night.
Today I feel fine and am not having any after effects 

All the Xanax ive done has been script so I  definitely haven’t gotten bad pills or anything

I can’t understand why I have had these reactions or lack thereof and was wonder if anyone else has a similar experience or explanation ",2,21,2025-01-22 20:44:00,dont understand xanax year half ago got hands .5mg xan hour popped feeling nothing made stupid choice shot two jack help boost effects made tired ended going sleep next three days worst days life dissociated fuck time moved slowly felt like three days lasted years tired unable sleep hell ’ understand hype decided id done em done xans fast forward six months ago uncle gave liquid xan flight approx 1-1.5mg worked great made little loopy passed slept whole flight woke felt fine didnt effects yesterday xanax third time took three .5mg nothing thing happened got really cold even though heat set 30c freezing even ended put two extra blankets bed thought maybe high realizing recorded watching videos confirm seemed completely normal didnt even end sleeping well woke multiple times throughout night today feel fine effects xanax ive done script definitely ’ gotten bad pills anything ’ understand reactions lack thereof wonder anyone else similar experience explanation

tried meth yesterday night.,"i had recently gotten into contact with an old friend who just so happened to be selling at $90/g. 

prior to reconnecting with him i had zero interest in trying it out as i knew how destructive the drug could be, but i just felt extremely tempted and i eventually gave in.
 
collected the small baggie and went up to my apartment and inspected it. it look pure and clean and i was sure i was going to have a hella fun night. took out about .5g and i was 100% sure i smoked it right as there were big fat clouds and i cleared pretty much everything in the pipe. surprisingly i did not get a “rush of euphoria” or any sort i just got super tingly on the scalp and had a fast heart rate alongside an uncomfortable stomach.

 waited an hour and 30mins to see if there were any more effects before redosing as i didnt want to put myself at risk of overdosing. after i waited i took out another .5g but this time i smoked the fucked out of it like no joke every single hair molecule on my body stood as i exhaled multiple fat clouds. i know i was definitely higher than before and i was definitely feeling euphoric but it lasted maximum of 20-30mins before it subsided into a more focus and mellow high which then resulted into me just going into reddit rabbit holes while listening to music.

was chasing the high from 11pm to 6am and eventually i was tempted to try snorting it to maybe see if the effects would be more stronger but as i was lining it up i just felt this extreme depression wash over me and i had no motivation to continue chasing the high anymore, i was food and sleep deprived and it went from a fun night to a horrible night. i took the bag of remaining meth and flushed it down the toilet as well as throw the pipe away as i did not want to touch this substance anymore.

also forgot to add in but i do have adhd which might be why i dont feel high from meth☹️",8,37,2025-01-22 11:01:10,tried meth yesterday night recently gotten contact old friend happened selling 90/g prior reconnecting zero interest trying knew destructive drug could felt extremely tempted eventually gave collected small baggie went apartment inspected look pure clean sure going hella fun night took .5g 100 sure smoked right big fat clouds cleared pretty much everything pipe surprisingly get “ rush euphoria ” sort got super tingly scalp fast heart rate alongside uncomfortable stomach waited hour 30mins see effects redosing didnt want put risk overdosing waited took another .5g time smoked fucked like joke every single hair molecule body stood exhaled multiple fat clouds know definitely higher definitely feeling euphoric lasted maximum 20-30mins subsided focus mellow high resulted going reddit rabbit holes listening music chasing high 11pm 6am eventually tempted try snorting maybe see effects would stronger lining felt extreme depression wash motivation continue chasing high anymore food sleep deprived went fun night horrible night took bag remaining meth flushed toilet well throw pipe away want touch substance anymore also forgot add adhd might dont feel high meth☹️

Let’s talk about benzos,"I abused benzos for years, I was dumb and took huge amounts not even knowing what I was doing to myself, now I’ve been tapering down for a while, and even now that I’m on a low dose I still have seizures if I go more than 24h without my dose.

I don’t like to make a diference between “soft” and “hard” drugs, but if I had to, I would say benzos are more on the hard side.

I see lots of people taking them like it is harmless (like I used to do).

Benzos can be a wonderful tool if you really need it and take it as prescribed, and for a short period of time.

If you want to have fun with them from time to time, go for it, if it’s really from time to time, just know that it’s very sneaky and you’ll easily find yourself using it daily so at least keep track from when you take it.

Don’t be like me and risk your life for it, I know lots of people like me take it because it makes them feel fine, without anxiety, just know that you can do lots of other things to help you with that.

If you’re responsible with them, that’s great, but if you have an addictive personality just think twice.

I’m tired of having to not forget to take them just so I don’t die.

How do people like the feeling of Adderall/Dexedrine?,"When I first tried Dexedrine as prescribed for my ADHD, I kind of lied to myself, convincing myself that I liked it. I kept taking it for about a week, but eventually, I just couldn’t handle it anymore and asked to be taken off it. To me, it doesn’t feel enjoyable at all, like people say it is. My head starts pulsing, my palms and armpits get sweaty as hell, and food just tastes like straight ass. Not to mention, I just feel uncomfortable the whole time.

One of the worst parts is how it messes with my stomach. I don’t even realize I haven’t eaten for like six to eight hours, and by the time I do, I’m starving. But when I try to eat, everything tastes like shit, and I end up gagging constantly. I have to force food down with water, and even when I manage to eat, I feel so nauseous that I almost want to throw up. So basically, I’m stuck choosing between being painfully hungry or feeling like throwing up at any given moment. And most of the time, I don’t even throw up—I just dry heave and gag a lot because I feel so nauseous.

Even if I take Dexedrine in the morning, it still affects my sleep. At night, I can feel my heart beating so fast, and I can’t relax even if I’m laying in my bed for an hour or two. And I know every guy that has an Adderall or Dexedrine prescription can relate to your dick shrinking for a bit. It’s so weird—it like deflates. On top of that, I have to pee every second, even if I don’t drink any water.

Dexedrine also makes me feel super energetic mentally, but anytime I pick up some weights or do any kind of physical activity, I get gassed so quickly. I feel weak and exhausted, even though in my mind, I feel so energetic.

But the nail on the coffin was when I was having a terrible day and just wanted to take something, so I took 60 mg three hours after my first dose of 30 mg that day (I don’t redose often). I felt like absolute shit, just like totally uncomfortable and overstimulated. It felt like vertigo but 100x the intensity.

Nitrous is so fiendish. I love/hate it,"So Friday night I hang out with this chick that lives down the street from me. I have been talking to her since September but she always has an excuse not to hang out. She is just shy and was nervous to meet me. Anyway I have been on a bit of a nitrous binge lately. I pick her up and she sees an empty nitrous tank on my back seat. She goes “oh my God you do whippits!? I LOVE WHIPPITS! Let’s buy some!” She sends me $100 and tells me to spend it all on nitrous. We hit the smoke shop and buy abunch of those tanks.

We pick up some beers and I drive us to the mountains. I know driving under the influence is bad and stupid and selfish, especially on a dangerous canyon road, but we are both the same type of depressed and didn’t give a shit at the time. We just spend all night getting high. We mess around a bit but during sex we just keep hitting the tank lol. At one point I convinced myself I was dead and floating above my body, I was just high af from constantly hitting the balloon. She didn’t even use a balloon, just hit it from the tank but I prefer the balloon way cause fuck freezing my lungs. To each their own. We were having a fucking blast.

Anyway it is like 4am and I invite her over to crash at my place. She keeps waking me up “were out we should get more!” And it got pretty annoying not gonna lie. Next morning she is still fiending and gives me more money to buy more “to help the hangover”. We do it all over again. She is more of a fiend than me, I was both impressed and disgusted, in the best way. She also hands me abunch of Xanax, but I saved that shit for later. Shits been kind of dry lately but now I know where to find shit so i’m happy.

Since then I have been taking a break from whippits to avoid depleting too much vitamin B. However, it is my day off work and I am probably going to hit her up to hang out, which means binging and fucking. Fuck it. At least I don’t have to do this shit alone anymore. Got a nitrous fiending fwb. Shes like the female version of myself, which is great but also terrible. Were both just two lonely 27 and 29 year olds and use drugs to cope. Match made in hell.

Need help. I need to know how Morphine pills are digested most efficiently,"I use morphine and xanax/kpin for motivation, anxiety and comfort. I don’t seek a huge high. I have tried nearly every drug I possibly can, and this combination is the best for me, beside oxy, but 80’s are too rare to find. I do 100-300mg morphine daily, and some days they work really well, while some days it’s like I didn’t take them at all. 

I noticed if I wake up really hungry the morphine works extremely well, while if I have eaten, they barely do anything. Would fasting and just consuming morphine be good, or would a keto diet make them more efficient, cause they cost alot. Luckily i’m friends with my dealer and I can get 30 200mg pills for 300-500 euros. I want to make the most out of the pills so I need a diet of some sort that helps with this. Are there supplements I can take? 1-2 day breaks seem to work well, but it’s still inconsistent. I heard ketamine can help with tolerance, aswell as antabuse (the no alcohol pill).

Will this work or cancel out?,"Yesterday I took 2 Xanax bars 1(4mg brom) and 1(2mg clobro).

Not concerned about death are anything like that, more so if drinking will be a waste. The left over Xanax from yesterday definitely mellowed out the fake adderall.

Edit: After my 1/2 redose total dosage 1.5 Adderalls(meth) effects were more prominent but still mellow. Pretty much without anxiety.

Candy flip with girlfriend?,"Question for those experienced with this. Me and my girlfriend want to take some MDMA soon and I'm considering doing a candy flip to spice it up a bit.

Thing is, my girlfriend has only done MDMA before. I don't want to give her LSD as a combo for the first time so I'm thinking I do a candy flip but she just does MDMA. Do you guys think the vibe will be good still or would you say we'd be on two different wavelengths because of this combo?

We've done MDMA together a handful of times and always have a good time but I wanted to see some opinions on this mixture.

Thanks!

What drug feels the most like the come up of anesthesia?,"I have had several surgeries in the last couple years that I had to go under general anesthesia for and I always kinda loved the rush and relaxation I felt in the few seconds before I fell asleep. 

Has anyone who knows that feeling had a similar feeling with a recreational drug? 

The closest thing I can relate it to us the warm fuzzy feeling in the face from oxycodone (which I was on for a few months in the hospital) but it is still different, I'm guessing because it is a much stronger sedative. What do you think?

Do not be a dumbass like me and mix tramadol with stimulants,"So the other day I scrolled Reddit for about 30 minutes and checked if it was okay to take a light dose of tramadol and adderall hours apart. Obviously Reddit is not a reliable source of info but pretty much every post I saw said as long as doses are low, it’d be fine

So early in the morning, I took 10mg of adderall, then around 6 hours later I took a 100 mg pill of tramadol. Keep in mind I just recently started doing adderall so I’m on a low dose, but I do tramadol recreationally so I’ve done doses up to 400+ and never had anything bad happen 

Once the tramadol started to kick in, I noticed i was stuttering my words so I started to get nervous and considered calling 911. By the time me and my friends got back to my car, I opened my door - then I blacked out and woke up in an ambulance. 

What my friends say happened was I opened the car door, but I started just staring up at the sky… I then proceeded to drop my water bottle, and completely collapse backwards on the ground into the car metal. 

I had to stay in the hospital for 6 hours and everything turned out fine. I just have a mild concussion 
 
*SIDE NOTE* I’m sharing this to avoid others from making the same mistake as me. I’ve already flushed every pill I own and don’t plan on taking anymore besides the kind I’m getting prescribed to me.

I’m already feeling an immense amount of guilt and depression so just to reiterate - I know what I did was stupid so I don’t need any hateful comments. 

So not only should yall not mix, but maybe lay off the tramadol all together. because I’ve tried much higher dosages of each substance on their own and never once felt anything bad except tramadol, which would sometimes cause muscle spasms and jerks.

"Coke - where do you draw the line between casual use, coke head, and full-blown addict?","So, used to date a girl who did cocaine.

Personally no issues with that cuz I'm no saint, but I mostly stick to softer drugs like LSD and Weed.

But her behaviour made me skeptical about her claims that she doesn't use coke ""that much"". Basically when we were out at techno clubs, she would act all friendly with other random strangers (guys especially) for free lines. Her sense of comfort was also so ruined to the point where she once approached a HA biker gang for cocaine...and even exchanged numbers with one of them. Also would randomly accept crystals (I assume MDMA crystal? It looked like a big fleck of salt) from strangers and would snort random powders offered to her from bottles with nozzles. All I found alarming, especially since we were technically on a date.

However, she seemed pretty ""normal"" at times - able to hold a conversation, charming on dates when we weren't at clubs, able to work 2 jobs punctually and responsibly (but I noticed, always job hopping). Does have hobbies like drawing and tattooing, and claims to love reading. I personally never really did cocaine or harder drugs before, but she also didn't seem to fit those Hollywood stereotypes of drug addicts you'd see, like in Requiem for a Dream.

Did drop out of university though, and admitted to smoking weed a lot in the past.

She did ended blocking me presumably because of my discomfort around her habits, but for my own closure and curiosity - where would the line be drawn between casual use vs coke head? Is her behaviour ""normal"" in the cocaine scene? I personally don't mind her doing cocaine, but it was the context and how she went about soliciting it that irked me.

P.S. Asking out of curiosity cuz she didn't seem to fit the stereotypes you see in media.

My liver is toast! No more drugs for me,"I’m grieving the loss of my lifestyle. I was a heavy opioid user back in my teens/early 20s. Went on suboxone for 10 years. Have been completely off for 2 years. Have never relapsed once with opiates. 
But I recreationally used ketamine, MDMA, alcohol on occasion, LSD and mushrooms. I tried to keep things at once a week would not go over twice a week. Never was a heavy drinker. I hate being drunk and hung over. 

Recently went to the ER for RUQ pain and they found my liver is struggling. I am not writing this to scare anyone or say that these drugs caused this issue. I have cystic fibrosis and a crazy immune system that over responds to everything. So it was more likely the amount of medication I am prescribed just to survive than the occasional indulgence. 

I am just grieving the loss of what I had. My main friend group and I used to go to see local band and use once a week (maybe twice if there was an exceptional lineup). I never overdosed or felt like I did too much. I kept things very light. But it enhanced the experience for sure. I worry that I won’t enjoy doing these things as much anymore. Or that maybe my friends won’t even want to hang out with me anymore now. 
My other friend group are big drinkers. Their idea of a good time is going out to a bar which doesn’t excite me at all. But they are good people who have always been a solid foundation. 

I guess I’m just struggling with the idea of having to find new hobbies and potentially new friends because I really liked the way my life was 😭",1,11,2025-01-22 14:54:46,liver toast drugs ’ grieving loss lifestyle heavy opioid user back teens/early 20s went suboxone 10 years completely 2 years never relapsed opiates recreationally used ketamine mdma alcohol occasion lsd mushrooms tried keep things week would go twice week never heavy drinker hate drunk hung recently went er ruq pain found liver struggling writing scare anyone say drugs caused issue cystic fibrosis crazy immune system responds everything likely amount medication prescribed survive occasional indulgence grieving loss main friend group used go see local band use week maybe twice exceptional lineup never overdosed felt like much kept things light enhanced experience sure worry ’ enjoy things much anymore maybe friends ’ even want hang anymore friend group big drinkers idea good time going bar ’ excite good people always solid foundation guess ’ struggling idea find new hobbies potentially new friends really liked way life 😭

I've had the most insane k-hole and can't stop thinking about it,"This was weeks ago, on New year's, I've had a tab of acid, half a mdma pill and then later on a few lines of ket. We were watching modern family and me and my partner both went into the khole at the same time. It was honestly the weirdest experience I've ever made. It was quite literally like I glitched out. I only saw static TV kind of glitch stuff (for a lack of better words) together with static loud sounds. For some reason I kept seeing a micro chip extending and connecting in me or my brain/body and generally all of it was super technology based, which probably was because we had been watching Modern Family on an iPad and the acid was at play.

"Accidentally took meth, gaining so much empathy for meth heads","I bought some “pressed adderall”  b974 online and did not do my research before hand. Turns out they are actually just meth and caffeine. I started by taking one orally to get some homework done and was unimpressed by the results. Around an hour later I decided to snort half of a pill and also didn’t feel to crazy of an affect. 
At this point I thought it was some weaker version of adderall so I decided to snort a few pills over the next few hours. I start to slowly realize my inability to stop snorting more. I wasn’t too high at this point despite having snorted around 150 mg of the pills. I decided to do some research and for the next two hours I had a meth fueled research where I repeatedly had to prove to myself they were meth (I was tweaking since I sold some to a person, immediately hit them up when I first started to have my suspicions and gave him a refund, luckily he hadn’t taken any yet so he was good) 
At this point I didn’t feel high at all and assumed if there was meth it was a tiny amount and continued to snort more. Eventually my friend invited me to go for a smoke and after 3 failed attempts of leaving my dorm and going back to snort another pill I finally started the journey to my friends dorm where I puked 3 times on the way. I admitted to them I got laced and asked them to come back with me to make sure I threw them away. I immediately regretted this and started to constantly try to assure them that I wouldn’t go back and do more (I was fully planing to) On the drive back to my dorm I was thinking of all the ways I could get some before my friend through it away, I even suggested throwing it in the dumpster (which I would of dug in later) it’s insane, it’s so fucking addictive. I begged my friend for a single pill before he disposed of it. I would have payed 300 for half of a b974. I would give anything right now for another bump, it’s terrifying. 
I completely understand why meth heads do crazy shit for just a bit of meth. I could totally see myself betraying my friends, it already made me lie to them, to get a bit more. I think I’m genuinely a person prone to addiction and I’m definitely addicted to other drugs like weed and nicotine but it’s completely different. If nicotine is like a 3 on a fien scale these fake addys are like a 10. The meth high isn’t even that good, the fiening and the high are like seperate, I’m not snorting more to get higher but to fulfill some insatiable need. 
I need to never do this again, fuck this, fuck meth, I’m so sorry for anyone struggling with meth addiction it’s gotta be literally so hard. I’m sure smoking meth has got to be even more addicting. Can’t even comprehend this. I’m gonna go search the floor for any I spilled earlier now, good luck o7 (also like any idea how long this will last? Is snorting have a similar timeline to snorting?

some drugs (mainly LSD and 2c-b) cause major itching on old surgery scars. any insight on why/how that happens?,"TLDR; LSD and 2c-b make the nerve damage under my scars flare up really bad. Wondering what physical effect could be causing that with these two drugs and not others (ie shrooms, dxm, ketamine)

Hey folks. I got a double masectomy in 2021 and would say I'm fully healed now. The scars don't itch during normal conditions, and I've regained a lot of feeling in the area, but it was a big surgery and I know there was a lot of nerve damage. 

About a year ago I took LSD for the first time since getting the surgery and the itching around the scars was unbearable, and didn't go away for at least 24 hours. I've also done 2c-b a few times, and on higher doses the itching is present and awful, but not as bad as the 2 tabs of LSD. This doesn't happen on shrooms, but I usually keep my shroom doses on the low end.

People have told me it's in my head but I've seen a handful of others stating the same experience with deep surgery scars, so I think it is actually irritating the scars or the nerves underneath somehow. 

My question is just, does anyone have any idea what specifically the LSD/2c-b could be doing to irritate the scars? I initially thought it was an allergic reaction, but anti-histamines did nothing, and the itching is solely focused around the scars. I'm pretty confident something is triggering the nerve damage, but I don't know enough about how the drugs work to know what, of all the things they do to your body, would be doing it. 

I mostly want to know what my body's doing because I'd love to find a way to counteract it, because otherwise acid tripping is a total no-go for me from now on. 

Any insight would be appreciated!

Friend shoots coke-- what's the stuff left over?,"As stated above ^ i have a friend that uses cocaine intravenously. I use it nasally.

Typically they use the same lil thing for the whole sesh and sometimes, ok almost always, it's not disposed of till the next day. What's the white shit crusted in it?

What’s the worst W/D?,"Top candidates: RC bzos/fety/alch

I’ve been through most addictions to a lot of substances. Teen years I liked uppers and 20s turned to downers. Had a 20 bean a day habit of fetty going cold turkey on. It was brutal. However I recently visited my close friend in the intensive care unit who had been ingesting copious amounts of flualp hulk bars with unknown doses but around 4mg each. I also have experience with benzo addiction and withdrawal but never to this degree. 

He was wandering around homeless in 10° (F) weather for days, delirious and seizing out until he was found at a church and taken to the hospital. He is now relatively stable and it’s been 5 days, but he’s still cognitively and physically going thru it bad. He said he was freezing and had 5 blankets on top of him 

Benzos are a silent killer.

Fetty kills you, the withdrawal makes you feel like you’re dying
Benzos won’t usually kill you..but the withdrawals will. The more potent the worse. Just like opes. Opium to fentanyl kpins to clonazolam but we should be treating this shit like real “dope” cuz that’s what it is.

My opinion: Benzo. And let’s put the seizure thing to the side just for the sake of this argument: FULL ON benzo withdrawl is like full on opiate withdrawal. Plus alcohol-like delirium and tremors. Ok now let’s remember benzos give you seizures

Quitting Weed for a Job. Need Something to Relax on Weekends.,"Hello. This is my first ever post on Reddit so bear with me. Im starting a new job in about 4 months from now. I’ve been using cannabis daily for about 3-4 years, mostly in the form of cartridges and flower. In the employee handbook they have a drug free workplace policy but with the way that it is written it seems like they probably won’t even drug test me for hire. I currently have a medical marijuana card, but am in a state where that does not matter in terms of employment. Again, I am not sure if I will even be drug tested. Regardless, I am going to quit smoking in a few weeks and give myself a little over three months to purge the THC from my system. At this point it literally feels like I am 50% THC and 50% human. Anyways, I am looking for something that does not show up on a drug test, or even general advice about quitting and my situation in general. This will be my first ever big boy job, and I can’t fail in the case that they actually do drug test. If I am not tested within the first year then I will cross the bridge of whether I want to start smoking again when I get there. Regardless, my body and mind need a break from daily consumption anyways. I want to remind myself that I can function without weed. In the meantime, I am thinking about other vices to use specifically at the end of a stressful week. It’s probably important to note that I do not like drinking alcohol. I drank for about 3 years 3-5 days a week and it really just got old. For 1-2 days you are just operating on 60% and the feeling/experience was never worth it. I also would randomly get heart palpitations and swelling of the neck I drank. Not to mention my father’s an alcoholic and I honestly tended to get angry when I drank. Hmmm. 

All of this information given has been completely irrelevant to my actual question lmao. At the moment I am thinking about buying some high quality kava to take on Friday’s and/or Saturday’s as a way to unwind, and escape. I know it is not healthy to replace one substance with another, but I’m a human being and everyone has their vices. 

Is kava something worthwhile? Any other suggestions on something I could take that will not make me pop hot on the good old drug test? And what are some ways to truly accept my farewell with cannabis, for now…?

Anyone else bored of getting fucked up? ,"For a bit of context here I’m 19, male, in college (doing my A-Levels a little late but better late than never) and I mainly smoke weed. I used to go out with my friends regularly and we’d basically always get fucked up (mainly on alcohol and cocaine) no matter where we went. Clubs, bars, parks, flats/apartments etc. Lately the idea of going out with my friends to get messed doesn’t excite me anymore, it’s actually kinda the opposite.

I used to love going out and getting fucked up, and a part of me definitely still does. And I’m also aware that I can still go out and get fucked up without making it a regular thing. However, recently I find myself questioning “what’s the point?”

I’m 19, 20 at the end of the year. Doing my A-Levels late in college and I have no work experience outside of around 2 years in hospitality and a few months in waste management. I wanna finish school, go to University and become an English teacher. I don’t wanna go out and spend my limited money on drugs/alcohol anymore. I don’t mind continuing to smoke weed, I really enjoy the way it makes me feel. Weed definitely helps me with stress. But I don’t wanna go out and get fucked up on things alcohol, cocaine, MDMA etc anymore

But at the same time I have people telling me things like “You’re 19 you’re still young go out and have fun whilst you can, you’re not even 20 yet!”And whilst I completely understand that mentality I also wanna do things with my life and time that actually benefit me and my future.

Experimented with Phenibut,"I live in a country where phenibut is sold as Noofen (the latvian brand for phenibut) without the need for a prescription. 

My first time I tried 500mg and redosed to 1000mg when I didn't really feel anything. The next day I seemed to enjoy music a bit more than usual however I didn't notice any of the euphoric effects it supposedly has. 

the next time I tried it I did 1500mg oon an empty stomach in the morning with a cup of coffee, again I seemed to get a very light version of the effects described but nothing special. 

I even went as far as dosing 2000mg but to no avail.....

I assume the little bits of effects I did get might have been placebo since the other experiences I read about it are praising phenibut as almost the best alternative to alcohol and even other uppers.   
I also never got the hangover which have been described as quite bad. 

So what Im wondering is, am I dosing incorrectly? do I have a tolerance? Is noofen just a shit brand? Any advice on how to get a better phenibut experience? 

TLDR:   
I tried phenibut, but it didn't do anything for me.

Don’t feel MDMA at all anymore?,"Hey,
I have a very very very long history of substance abuse as well as mental healthy issues and have been on a myriad of different mental health medications. Currently only take trazadone for sleep. The first few times I tried MDMA it was fantastic music sounded amazing extremely social and euphoric almost no side effects when I was on it besides the next day would be a little rough (was taking Effexor and lithium when using mdma these times) I then got off of lithium and mdma doesn’t do anything at all to me really. I have taken it quite a fair amount of times however I have taken over year long breaks and still have the same outcomes. When I take a .1-.3 I kinda just feel a slight buzz. No increase in the enjoyment music , no social lubrication, no lovey dovey feeling, physical touch feels normal. After being off of the lithium I have taken it on Effexor and same results. I got off of Effexor and same results. There also was a period of time where I was addicted to meth for about 3-4 months and was not sure if that could have completely rewired my brain. Sorry for the word vomit but my main questions are: Why is this happening? If it was the lithium that made the Molly feel great for me is there a shorter acting version of a drug that will do the same thing lithium does that I can take concurrently with MDMA to be able to roll again? Is this strictly due to tolerance? (I feel like it can’t be cause I’ve taken loads of time off of mdma then taken it again with the same lackluster results) Last question: Is there any RC that will feel very similar to a Molly roll if there isn’t a fix to make it work again?

Odd effects after smoking. Help?,"So, I own a cart that has all the deltas in it. 8,9,10. As well as thca. It’s 2.5g. I also have recently smoked 2 joints within one day. One was a liquid diamonds sativa one and the other just a hybrid. 

I’ve been experiencing some odd symptoms after smoking and wanted to see if things normal. In total I’ve been smoking for only a couple months and would hit my cart once every 2 weeks or so. I’d do about 3-6 deep good hits. The time I smoked 2 joints(2weeks ago) was the first time I’ve tried them. 

So here’s what I’ve experienced. 

The couple nights after I’ve had extremely vivid dreams with realism I’ve never experienced before. They included concepts and feelings I wasn’t able to fully understand in the their world upon awaking. I would experience something in the dream but have no way to explain it. 

One of the things I saw the following night after smoking the joints is this man. A man in a suit, (not the hatman) his face was gone. It was an endless void instead of his face. I could see the white outline of his face but everything else on the front was just one big void. I kept imagining him for some odd reason. 

The next day, while I was in class I started feeling “smarter”. My writing in my essays and my thinking skills increased dramatically. I was writing better than ever before and my thought process was aswell. I started creating solutions to problems at a faster pace. Any problem I’d encounter I always had a way to solve it, almost like I had higher iq. 

I began getting new ideas and even getting better at the video games I play out of no where. I’ve started noticing little details in people I never saw before. Any twitch of their finger during a conversation, any eyebrow twitch or even a subtle turn. I wasn’t looking for these changes but I saw them. I started to being able to tell the mood of a person simply off how they walked and talked. 

My communication skills allowed me to have deeper conversations with people and unlock bonds with strangers that i never thought I could until I became their best friend. My view of reality and the existence of things has changed. Instead of observing what I see. I started to observe what I feel and what others see. My imagination increased aswell and allowed me to think of things a lot lore clearly then ever before. I could come up with ideas so much faster. 

(All of this is days/weeks after smoking btw), 

it’s like my brain has rerouted and gained another subconscious level of higher thinking that I never thought I had. Final question remains, is this normal? Feel free to ask more questions I’m happy to talk about it, in fact, I encourage you ask me questions.

I need help. My boyfriend is addicted to spice and I don’t know how to help him,"EDIT: I just wanna say thank you so much for all your kinds words and advice so far. I’m seriously feeling way calmer and better and more hopeful and I have some new ideas for what to do. I’ll be updating the post soon hopefully and I’ll be praying for u all. 

Hello, basically I'm 21 female my bf is 22 male and we have been together for 5 years. For our entire relationship we have been using drugs and alcohol but for about 2 years now we have been on a sobriety journey.
I somehow managed to not get addicted to anything except nicotine but unfortunately he got addicted to being intoxicated in general. Constantly looking for the next strongest thing. An issue we often had was that he couldn't ever just be okay with being baked. He always had to be the most intoxicated he can possibly be. He became badly addicted to hash and weed. Which was one hell of an issue on its own, then out of no where he became addicted to spice. It was to the point that he got caught at work, left uni and lost his job and is now doing out patient rehab once a month. (The rehab place is super full so he can't meet w the therapist more than once a month) he's on sleep medication and mood stabilizers now. Me and his family finally found a rehab place for him after the worst paper bender he's had so far. It was a month long and absolute hell. So much screaming and crying for him to stop. If ur not familiar w spice it's basically up there w the really hard drugs. The come down is horrible and so are the withdraws. And the high is insanely strong. When he's on it he's basically asleep or out of it completely unable to speak and unable to function for days or weeks at a time.
As his girlfriend I really do not want to leave him. He's the love of my life and I don't have the stomach to leave while he's in such a low point in his life. really I just don't see my self leaving him any time soon. I try to just be there for him and give him the love and support he needs but this time l lost my mind. He was sober for a month and was finally past the worst of the withdrawal. He was sleeping and eating again. Then he relapsed. And it's been almost 2 weeks now that he's been on spice daily. I don't know what to do. I lost my mind. I screamed and swore at him which is insanely out f character for me. I've never sworn at him like this before. I told him how he’s not just failing him self but he’s also completely fucking up my life. I have no friends and a shit relationship w my family. And it all comes back to him. I told him I can’t deal w this much longer and that I’m close to being done w this if he doesn’t stop. And basically I’m at the brink of hurting my self or loosing my mind completely. I don’t know how to deal w this. I’m just a 21 year old girl. Nothing in life prepared me for this. I need help. Please help me. If anyone has any advice on how to help me finally get sober please tell me.

Is it beneficial to take shrooms with a bad headspace?,"My friend and I recently bought 14g of pretty potent shrooms. My friend has already tried them and said he had an amazing experience, and I’m eager to try them as well, especially since I paid for half. However, there’s a problem. I’m not in the best mental state right now; I’ve been feeling quite anxious and a little depressed over the past week or two, which couldn’t have happened at a worse time since we just got the shrooms recently.

I’ve heard mixed opinions about taking shrooms while in a bad headspace. Some people claim it can be a great way to rejuvenate healing and relieve anxiety/stress, while others warn that taking psychedelics while in a bad mental state only leads to a bad trip. I’ve never tripped before, so I can’t say for sure. I’ve heard people say that there’s no such thing as a bad trip, only challenging experiences that teach you something, and a part of me wants to believe that, but I’m not sure I’d feel the same way if I actually had a bad trip myself.

So, I’m torn between the idea of tripping right now as opposed to trying to heal and work on my mental health first, without the use of any drug or psychedelic, and then come back to it when I feel I’m in a good headspace. I mean, it’s not like it’s going to disappear if I don’t do it right now, so I can definitely wait. It’s just that I’d prefer to do it sooner than later, especially since my friend hyped them up so much. 

I would love to hear if anyone has had a similar dilemma as me, and what you ended up doing. Even if you haven’t had this problem before, but feel that you’re educated on psychedelics enough to help me, I would love to hear your thoughts too.",2,28,2025-01-22 02:20:19,beneficial take shrooms bad headspace friend recently bought 14g pretty potent shrooms friend already tried said amazing experience ’ eager try well especially since paid half however ’ problem ’ best mental state right ’ feeling quite anxious little depressed past week two ’ happened worse time since got shrooms recently ’ heard mixed opinions taking shrooms bad headspace people claim great way rejuvenate healing relieve anxiety/stress others warn taking psychedelics bad mental state leads bad trip ’ never tripped ’ say sure ’ heard people say ’ thing bad trip challenging experiences teach something part wants believe ’ sure ’ feel way actually bad trip ’ torn idea tripping right opposed trying heal work mental health first without use drug psychedelic come back feel ’ good headspace mean ’ like ’ going disappear ’ right definitely wait ’ ’ prefer sooner later especially since friend hyped much would love hear anyone similar dilemma ended even ’ problem feel ’ educated psychedelics enough help would love hear thoughts

"5mg/10mg Diazepam safe to take as a one-off thing?

From a one-time 5mg or 10mg dose, is any memory loss possible or even blackout? Would the comedown be bad in any way? Are there any other potential negative effects? I've heard of people having seizures and withdrawls from the same 10mg I'd be taking, how come taking it just once is so different?

Highest I’ve been off Dexedrine,"Today, I had a final exam, and I took 45mg of Dexedrine SR to help me focus. After probably bombing the exam, and being super pissed off about it, I decided I just wanted to feel good so I took 60mg more three hours later, by taking two capsules and crushing the third one to get some IR effects. At first, I felt much better, no longer angry or upset about the exam. But now, I’m pretty sure I only felt that way because the initial 45mg SR and about 15mg IR that I crushed had kicked in so far.

An hour later, I’m starting to feel a bit uncomfortable, though not necessarily in a bad way. I’m lying down while writing this, and when I make even tiny movements, they feel super exaggerated. The best way I can describe how I feel is that like I’m floating. Like my bed is made of air and I am suspended above it. Lying down in my bed feels strange, almost like I’m not entirely in control of my body. My sense of touch is turned to the max, rubbing my hands together or moving my legs across my mattress feels so much more sensitive than usual. My head also feels very sensitive. Like sensitive to light, sensitive to blinking, sensitive to sound, and I have a sort of pulsing sensation in my head, as well as feeling the blood rushing through my entire body. 

I don’t know if I like how I feel right now. I definitely don’t hate it, it’s not to the point where it’s too overstimulating, though I know that if I stood up right now it would definitely be too overstimulating. 

Do you think I took too much, or is this just what a higher dose of Dexedrine is supposed to feel like?

Update: I had to stand up and move to the couch where my phone charger was, because i feel like if my phone died and i was just in my room in the dark I wouldnt have a very good time, because as this point i was seeing figures in the corners of my vision. I stood up and confirmed that I was way too disoriented and lacked basic motor functions such as walking in a straight line. I honestly felt like I was going to fall because I was so dizzy and lightheaded. It felt like vertigo as I also had blurred vision, but much more intense. I was walking in a sort of autopilot mode, because all my focus was on not falling down, walk in a straight line without losing balance, and making it to the couch, which was probably like 20ft away in the other room. When I finally got my charger and laid back down, I felt like I barely made it in time and if I had to stand any longer I would actually die. I was still so overstimulated and disoriented for a couple minutes after laying down and could’ve sworn I saw things that weren’t there outside of my window. Even now after lying down for 10 more minutes I’m still coming up and feel like I’m about to reach the peak. I can literally feel blood rushing through my body and every single hair follicle on my body rubbing against the couch. This is like my 3rd post today because I’m so restless and uncomfortable right now, but have no one to talk to. This also serves as a note to myself not to dose this high ever again, and a warning to anyone considering taking such a high dose if you have no prior tolerance, unless you’re really prepared for it, or you like being extremely wired. 

Update 2: if you ever find yourself in the same situation as me, tweaking off too much Dexedrine or any other amphetamine, I just found out that shavasana guided meditation videos on YouTube really help me calm down. Obviously it didn’t help with the side effects such as dizziness, nausea and heightened senses that much, but it helped me calm down and feel less stimulated for sure. Additionally, since my eyes were closed I wasn’t hallucinating as much. And because of the breathing exercises I got my heart rate down a bit.

Friend is in drug psychosis - need advice,"I have zero experience in this area, I’m so ignorant so please be kind. 

A little back story - my friend has been addicted to h for many years and developed drug psychosis. He’s been in and out of rehabs but no one can convince him he is in psychosis. Even when he has been sober for a few months, at the most, there is a part of him that still believes in some of these delusions.He recently got evicted, he’s 41, is now homeless and has been smoking meth. He called me the other night really high. He was talking and pacing and making “aggressive” grunts out of frustration. I don’t think he’s actually aggressive but I’ve never been around someone on meth yet alone in psychosis. It gave me a small picture of how terrible addiction is, I feel like this is so far out of my scope, the phone call made me nervous. 

Im visiting the city he lives in and was planning on meeting up with him while I was down there. Im looking for some advice as I dont know enough about addiction at the level. Should I skip seeing him? Would it be unsafe (I’m female)? If I do see him, is there anything I should be aware of? Should I bring anything to help him as he’s homeless now? I’m not looking to save him, just provide support if possible.

Are benzos worth trying if only short term?,"Sorry for the rant feel free to skip to the last paragraph if you just want the overview of what I’m asking.

I’m 17, turning 18, and right now I have my physics, math, and chemistry diplomas. The studying has left me feeling completely burnt out and pissed off as my last 3-4 days have just been studying all day. No matter how many hours I put in, I still feel like I’m struggling. It’s honestly been really depressing, making me feel like I’m dumb and a failure because of my low grades. To make it worse, my parents, even though I know they didn’t mean it, told me that if I continue to slack off in school and get low grades, I’ll end up a failure, a garbage collector, or maybe even a bum on the streets. This additional pressure has really gotten to me because I don’t want them to think they raised a failure. They also said that if I don’t get 75% or higher in all my courses, which would require me to score 85% or above on most of my diplomas to reach that 75% average, I won’t be able to rely on them for anything, food, money, nothing. They’ll only provide a room for me to stay in until I have to move out in probably 4-5 years. All this pressure has built up, and when I wrote my first physics diploma, I felt like I did poorly. That just added more anger and frustration, both toward myself and school, and now I’m even more stressed about the remaining two diplomas. The people who’ve already written the math and chemistry diplomas say they’re really tough, which makes me even more worried.

Now, with only one day left until my second diploma, I’m feeling anxious and overwhelmed. When I try to study, which is hard because of all the thoughts racing in my head, I just get really pissed off, to the point where I even ripped up one of my worksheets, because I hate not understanding the concepts and having to learn them on my own with no extra support. I’ve finished studying for now, but I’m still second guessing whether I’m prepared or if I should study more even though I’ve completed the practice exams and review booklets 2 times over. 

Do you think taking benzos, which I can get from a reliable source, would help me, just for this short period of time during my exam week? I’ve got so many thoughts racing through my head, that I’m not good enough to pass, that I’m going to end up on the streets, that I didn’t study enough, and that I’m pissed off that I can’t solve this math problem. From what I’ve heard, benzos help with anxiety and overthinking. I can get 4-5 of them from someone I know and trust, but my biggest concern is that I don’t know if I’ll get more once I run out. If they’re really that addictive, I might reconsider using them, and just smoke weed or take dexedrine, but since I’ve never tried them before I’m not sure. So my question is, would taking benzos short term, for 1 week but almost everyday, to ease my anxiety and stress be worth it, or will it lead me down a path that’s hard to escape?",2,20,2025-01-21 23:34:22,benzos worth trying short term sorry rant feel free skip last paragraph want overview ’ asking ’ 17 turning 18 right physics math chemistry diplomas studying left feeling completely burnt pissed last 3-4 days studying day matter many hours put still feel like ’ struggling ’ honestly really depressing making feel like ’ dumb failure low grades make worse parents even though know ’ mean told continue slack school get low grades ’ end failure garbage collector maybe even bum streets additional pressure really gotten ’ want think raised failure also said ’ get 75 higher courses would require score 85 diplomas reach 75 average ’ able rely anything food money nothing ’ provide room stay move probably 4-5 years pressure built wrote first physics diploma felt like poorly added anger frustration toward school ’ even stressed remaining two diplomas people ’ already written math chemistry diplomas say ’ really tough makes even worried one day left second diploma ’ feeling anxious overwhelmed try study hard thoughts racing head get really pissed point even ripped one worksheets hate understanding concepts learn extra support ’ finished studying ’ still second guessing whether ’ prepared study even though ’ completed practice exams review booklets 2 times think taking benzos get reliable source would help short period time exam week ’ got many thoughts racing head ’ good enough pass ’ going end streets ’ study enough ’ pissed ’ solve math problem ’ heard benzos help anxiety overthinking get 4-5 someone know trust biggest concern ’ know ’ get run ’ really addictive might reconsider using smoke weed take dexedrine since ’ never tried ’ sure question would taking benzos short term 1 week almost everyday ease anxiety stress worth lead path ’ hard escape

Took a medium-low dose of DXM and been feeling weird,"It’s currently Tuesday for me right now, I took around 420 mg of DXM HBr on Sunday night, I did it with two friends. Me and on of the friends who did it, had pretty bad join panic attacks for about an hour. He took more than me because he’s almost double me weight, I weigh 135lbs, but not too much more than me. Anyways, obviously we had a bad trip but neither of us were in the dangerous range of getting Serotonin Syndrome, at least I believe. The next day after the trip, we got the afterglow, and it was going pretty good in the morning but as the day progressed me and him both said it got worse, and we both had increased heart rates and still very anxious. Now for some background me and this friend both do have diagnosed anxiety so it isn’t abnormal for either of us to freak out about things like school and everyday life. Back to the day after the trip, Monday, and I recorded my heart rate being around a steady 96 bpm, which was really freaky to me as that’s pretty high. The next day when I got some I decided not to smoke any thc as I knew it would make me feel worse. Since then I’ve been in weird headspace, things just seem somewhat off.

Here we are to right now as I post this. I decided to get high, and my heart rate has been at a steady 124bpm since I got high.

does where you smoke weed make you higher,"I remember reading something a while ago that where you smoke weed factors in how high you get. For instance if you were to smoke weed inside watching a youtube video or TV show etc. you won't get as high as when your walking since your brain wouldnt be as active as well as your oxygen and blood circulation. I was wondering if this held any validity. On face value it sounds like it would be true.

Help with Identifying Odd Items - Maybe Drug Paraphernalia,"Can someone help identify the items in the photo and how they might be used for drug use if at all?

Background:

My brother and his current wife have had a long history of dealing with drug addiction issues. They have both struggled for decades, nearly and during that time have gone through a lot of pain and struggle and caused a lot of of that for our family and for their children. This has gone on for close to 15 years one and off at different times for my brother and for his now wife very similar circumstances.

They both have many children and while they’ve been on drugs, they’ve been homeless unavailable lost, in and out of treatment that they never completed and arrested in many cases .

Two years ago, my brother and his girlfriend at the time both managed to somehow find a way forward and have been on the path to recovery. They both quit using drugs and sort of focusing on their health and getting jobs and making pretty good wages and even have begun to save money for a home. This is all good news, and my brother and his girlfriend eventually have gotten married. 

For about the last year, my mother has allowed them to stay at their home while they continue to get back on their feet. My brother’s wife is being treated by a methadone clinic and has treatments that she has occasionally taken, but seems to be more recently be taking more often.. She keeps the methadone that she’s prescribed in a safe in the bedroom where her and my brother stay and my brother has also recently had his own teeth in that space.

Lookout: recently my mother started noticing some unusual behavior and assume that my sister-in-law and brother’s wife left her methadone treatments on top of the safe or dresser, which caused a lot of concern because there are children in the house. The containers are in child proof cases, but still it’s possible that one of them could get into the treatment.

My brother and her are both always very apologetic and explain away the reason for why they left it out . My sister-in-law has been acting very odd in her routine seem to be shifting. She and my brother are very tired and their behavior seems off. Additionally, the Roomba vacuum has been collecting small paper under my brother’s bed and nightstand that seems to be placed with other items like razor blades and alcoholic pads. 

Can someone help me identify what these items might be and is it likely the related to any kind of drug use?

Fuck man. I am so tired. Long post in the description.,"I don’t know what to do. I’ve been sober from opiates and Xanax for 4 years. The cravings will not fucking stop. I was taking 7-hydroxymitragynine 2-3 times a week for the cravings, then my kidneys shut down. They randomly shut down in the middle of the night. Started projectile vomiting, then vomiting blood. Spent a fucking week in the hospital. Doctors still don’t know what’s wrong… this happened at the beginning of the month. 

It gets better. It started the day I was going on a road trip to my home town, for my girlfriend’s baby shower. Drove several hours trying not to puke, in constant pain, but I told her my family was so excited to throw her a shower. I was going to end up there, but obviously I was in the hospital. Then I returned home, was in constant pain to the point I had to go back to the hospital. I have a nephrologist appointment soon. 

I am terrified guys. I’m about to be a dad. I know I’m going to love my kid, be there, and be sober. But how the fuck do I stay sober? I know the answer, but what do I do with the cravings?? I don’t know. Kratom (leaf or 7-hydroxy) was my cure for the cravings. Shit helped me infinitely. But my kidneys are fucked now, at age 26, so that’s out of the window. I know I won’t relapse on pills or meth. I’m just worried about the cravings.

Luckily I can drink alcohol and smoke weed like a normal person. For the most part. I have abused alcohol, but only at my low points in life. But the past few years I’ve been responsible. Meth put me in rehab in 2023, I was suicidal too. I’ve been clean from everything (my DOCs longer) for a full year. Weed, shrooms, ketamine, and alcohol are the only things I’ve consumed this year. 

I plan on going to CMA, HA and CA meetings again, I just need that push. I have to be here for my kid. I can’t be laid up in a hospital on dialysis. I can’t be nodding off in a trap house. I can’t be in rehab. I have to be here. But these intrusive, extremely strong cravings are killing me. I don’t know how to live off opiates/things like kratom. 

I’ve been using opiates and pills since I was 14. The reason I’m posting this is because I have no one to talk to that truly understands. I’m sorry for my rambling, I don’t even need advice. I just had to get this off my chest.

I‘ve got an MRI of my skull tomorrow and i‘m a little nervous about the sounds and my current situation.,"Hi guys! ☺️

Due to an bike-accident omw to work (I‘m working as a nurse at a hospital) I got injured with a subdural- and epidudalhaemetome.
This all happened months ago but my employee and doctor recommended a follow-up MRI, which also will be the first one for me.

My question is:
- Will my recent MDMA & Cocaine/Ketamine session last weekend be visible in there?
- I‘m currently temporalely taking small doses of Alprazolam (1-2mg) (i don’t have anxiety or any psycologic diseases, just for insomnia) nightly for helping me fall asleep. 
I used Ambien (Zolpidem 10mg) previously as my insomnia treatment but I don‘t got any of them anymore. 

- Would you recommend me taking alprazolam prior to the MRI or is lorazepam 2.5mg (Tavor) which the doctor would give me more indicated for the MRI?

I don‘t think i‘m claustrophobic, but the sounds are kinda scary and since the MRI will be focusing on my head, they don‘t allow wearing earphones.

Any good advices or experiences of you would be very appreciated.
Thank‘s in advance.

Pupils different sizes at all times,"Has anyone else experienced this and does it ever go away? 

I'm a poly substance addict, mainly benzos and DXM but I also use codeine, zolpidem or anything else I can get my hands on. Anything that gets me fucked up with a preference for benzos or dissociatives/opioids. Currently I'm using DXM regularly (every few days, sometimes multiple days in a row) and was using benzos daily but I've been sober for a few days due to running out, not by choice. My pupils have been different sizes for a while now, I don't know exactly how long but a while. Even when I'm sober they stay different sizes. They'll still dilate like normal when I'm high and usually go back to normal size after a while of being sober but they remain different sizes even when dilated or back to normal. 

I've seen that can be a sign of brain damage and also seen that DXM abuse can cause brain damage. But I've also seen that pupils being different sizes can be due to drugs too so I'm wondering if it's just the fact that I've been using so many drugs at such high doses or if I could've caused myself some kind of brain damage. And if it's worth seeing a doctor for?

It appears that Trump has followed through with a pardon of Ross Ulbricht - Creator of Silk Road,">President Trump on Tuesday granted a pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road drug marketplace and a cult hero in the cryptocurrency and libertarian worlds.

>In doing so, Mr. Trump fulfilled a promise that he made repeatedly on the campaign trail as he courted political contributions from the crypto industry, which spent more than $100 million to influence the outcome of the election. A Bitcoin pioneer, Mr. Ulbricht, 40, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 2015, after he was convicted on charges that included distributing narcotics on the internet.

>

>“I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbright to let her know,” Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, misspelling Mr. Ulbricht’s name and making a reference to federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.

Some good news and long overdue.  Regardless of one's politics, those of us who use drugs and who have used technology, encryption, TOR, and crypto to access drugs in a safer, less violent way, can be grateful that a small justice has taken place.  

There's plenty of work that still needs to be done in the pursuit of humane drug policy, but glad to hear that Ross is free.

How to Reduce Anxiety and High Blood Pressure from Generic Ritalin (10mg IR)?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently purchased generic Ritalin 10mg IR (immediate release) to use this weekend, but I often experience increased blood pressure and some anxiety when I take it. I was wondering if there’s any way to make the release more gradual, like turning it into a long-acting (LA) version, or if anyone has tips to reduce these side effects?

ODSMT withdrawal question,"So I’ve been using Odsmt for about 2 months now.

I take it once every three days at 50-60 mg.

I’ve noticed no signs of withdrawal or tolerance increasing, and the only negative effect is that I have noticeably worse memory for its duration. I also feel no desire to increase my dosage. 

Are there long term side effects from taking this? Is there anything I should look out for that I might be missing?

I just want to double check with the community to make sure I’m not going to slowly kill myself.

Thank you friends",3,4,2025-01-21 17:18:32,odsmt withdrawal question ’ using odsmt 2 months take every three days 50-60 mg. ’ noticed signs withdrawal tolerance increasing negative effect noticeably worse memory duration also feel desire increase dosage long term side effects taking anything look might missing want double check community make sure ’ going slowly kill thank friends
Crying… partner in hospital due to over usage of nitrous,"Not looking for advice. Just looking for some comfort. My partner of two years has a tendency to resort to nitrous whenever he’s feeling stressed (which I wasn’t aware of). I only knew he used it socially with the guys, but I didn’t know he was also using it as a stress reliever. He hid it from me, knowing I’m not a fan of substances.

One day, he started feeling pain in his legs and hands. It got so severe that he started to lose mobility and balance, and next thing you know, we’re at the hospital. After rounds of tests, it was identified there’s a severe B12 deficiency, and that was when I realised the extent of his usage. I feel so hurt and upset. I care so much about him, his health, and our future together. I do my best for him, like always cooking him healthy food with veggies. And now, I’m also taking leave to look after him in the hospital.

It’s just so hard to watch someone I care about essentially have his life ruined right in front of my eyes. He’s lost all mobility, can’t go to work, can’t pay his mortgage, and can’t go on the holidays we had planned. I feel so so sad and confused, and I can’t stop crying.

Am I safe to use DXM today?,"Ive used DXM a lot, probably around 11 times while using week per plat between every trip. For the past month or two (haven't used DXM in like half a year), I've been having weird heart feelings. It kinda feels like palpitations, but it more so feels like the anxious kind of feeling you get in your chest but it usually isn't paired with any anxiety. It isn't painful, but it's uncomfortable/kinda alerting. It'll last for like 30 seconds to a minute until it goes away

I was planning a trip for back in December, but i didn't do it because of my heart. I've been to 2 doctors, including my primary care physician, and they took EKGs. They said my heart looks fine, and from what my Smart Watch tells me, my heart rate isn't irregular. Even though it sometimes feels like my heart is racing, my heart rate stays consistent. I had a Holter monitor on for 24 hours, but I haven't turned it in to the cardiologist yet. I didn't feel any heart irregularities today or yesterday until I started thinking about taking DXM, making me think that this is mostly in my head (I have a history of OCD regarding things like this, and I was a massive hypochondriac when I was in elementary/middle school. I went to the doctors almost 2 times or more a month)

My question is: if I take DXM today, what's the chance that something bad happens to me? I'm only planning on taking a 2nd plat dose, probably taking around 200mg or less, and maybe redosing up to 300mg if everything is fine. Is it a bad idea to take DXM tonight?

How bad is withdrawal from HHC vape pens… ,"Background I am 61 🔄 and l've been addicted to specifically HHC vape pens for at least a year and a half. I have never tried quitting before with the soul reason being I never wanted to. I have heard many times from many people that getting sober is impossible unless you actually want to. 

Well recently I had what we believe to be a miscarriage, being that I never knew there was a possibility of being pregnant and I am prone to missing periods due to other medical factors, i was unpleasantly surprised when I had the worst period of my life, without going into to much detail it was extremely painful, messy and left me calling the hospital where I was told it's likely a miscarriage and there's nothing they can really do at this point in time. This news led me to want to quit. And I mean it this time. I don't want to rely on a silly vape to get me through the day, I most definitely am fed up of the money I am wasting on them when it could be going towards a car.

But what drug or type of drug would a psychopath use for pure entertainment? I don't think I found anything useful on the internet, so maybe this can be the right place to ask.

Using coke as a tool too overcome speeches/presentations,"I started doing a software developer course, but the school requires me to give alot of presentations.

Medication and drugs,"Hi! I am currently working on a book and I need some help with the drugs used by some of the characters. 

1. I have a character that struggles with obsessive and delusional behaviour, mixing fantasy and reality. Borderline stalking someone. What kind of medication/drugs would be used to treat this, both in our current time and back in the early 1900's? 

2. I also have a character that mostly takes drugs to escape reality, like going through the day without having to feel all the anxiety and reality of his situation. What would be used in this instance?

And if it's not a bother, could you please explain how it would make one feel to use these drugs. How does it make your body and mind feel after taking them. Do you feel numb, does your limbs feel heavy or your eyes clouded?

at what point do drugs start to become a issue,"
so over the past 2 years i have been dabbling in diffrent types of drugs. it started with trying shrooms afterprom my junior year, my first trip was underwhelming because i only had a few bites out of a mushroom bar. the next trip i ate 2g of dried mushrooms and holy shit i wasnt expecting to trip so hard.  after that i did mushrooms every other week until one night me and my friend took shrooms and one of them passed out. watching my friends eyes roll back was terrifying and after that smoking weed started to give me panic attacks so i chilled down on the mushrooms. until me and my friends decided that we wanted to try acid. after we did acid for the first time i fell in love. it wasn’t like shrooms where one weird thought can make you spiral so we started doing acid the same amount as we used to do shrooms. after doing acid i slowly stopped caring about the drugs that i tried but i made a rule for myself that i would log every drug that went into my body (besides weed thats impossible for me lol) so i can see if my drug usage was becoming a problem. meanwhile i stayed in school and graduated with a 4.5 gpa and got top 50 of my class by the time i graduated. and with my gpa and some connections i was able to get a apprenticeship thats pays for my school and potentially will give me a job when i graduate college. however this apprenticeship required a pre employment drug test so i had to quit smoking weed. thankfully though this forced t-break helped me break my panic attacks i was having while high. and a few months after i got the job i continued to smoke. my love for drugs continued and eventually i did mdma, xanax, 2cb and lorazepam.
until this week everything was fine until one of my friends hinted to his mom that i was doing more then just weed because of some petty reason. and unfortunately my mom and his mom are basically family and my mom found out. my mom got pissed and i told her everything ive done and she wasn’t happy. and after that happened i just cant stop thinking if this is going to become a issue down the road. i haven’t gotten any long term damage or anything that would be a cause for concern, but i know how fast things can spiral out of control so im going to ask you guys what you think i should do.

Cops took my prescription pills into evidence,"I’ve been looking for an answer to this specific question for days i guess it’s a pretty rare scenario. Essentially on the 10th i had an overdose on something that turned out be mainly fent. my family at home called the cops and EMT’s ect. (side note: i thank god everyday i survived and am here to get my life back on track. the fact that i was od’ing on fent was a huge wake up call when i came back to consciousness. and went to jail but that’s a different story lmao). basically the cops went through all of my paraphernalia/wallet/keys, ect. on my keys i have a keychain container somewhat filled with klonopin im prescribed in case of emergencies and im not home with the pill bottle. i get out of jail and retrieve my stuff and im not surprised but the container is gone. i’m not mad about it, like i said i understand under those circumstances it’d make sense. i guess my question would be if its at all likely id get this back. i really want the canister back more than anything it was a gift lol

I despise this part of myself,"definitely venting but this is the only real place where my actual feelings are likely to find someone who understands them.  I love drugs, I love hallucinogens, I love doing new chemicals, I also hate drugs, in every single way, nothing about their effects is ever worth it, the downsides continue to build up, I keep doing new different drugs just to try them only to never be the same after, and the amount of times I’ve had to get acclimated to new states of life only for them to be changed up entirely again is more than I can count, but I cannot stop doing drugs.  with everything besides weed it’s not an addiction issue, weed which most definitely has had most of the original downsides (previous posts on hppd I’ve described those downsides) but is still one of the more well handled downside, I never really was majorly bothered by the visual after effects or mental stupidity except in extreme periods of binging.  Weed is “difficult” for me to quit in the sense I have very little motivation too, smoking with my brothers is the few times we ever talk/hangout, and with it constantly accessible it’s just convenient to use, I also semi-require it to deal with my minor arfid and major insomnia which has worsened since I’ve started using weed to cope with it.  I cannot stop trying new drugs when given the opportunity, it’s like my autistic desire to be aware of/know everything is incapable of not taking the opportunity to experience a new reality, even though every time I regret it more than the last.  deep down I’ve always convinced myself that constant weed is the pallet of which all of my other mental downsides stem from but without ever quitting weed long term since all of the other drugs I don’t really know how true that is, I’m scared of never regaining my full ability to process myself, reality, my own thoughts, or never regaining the ability to picture things in my head, everything’s genuinely been fucked up, it’s 100% related to the fact I had just went through an extreme argument while I and my ex were in manic episodes and was incapable of understanding the situation and the major inability to connect with the only person I ever really understood, and yet my desire to get more accustomed with acid, and my total mental disconnect from what I had just experienced made me be impatient waiting for my normal dealer, and get fucked over by another I made the choice to buy from.  I keep blaming Him and tons of other people for my mistakes when they are entirely on me, I keep blaming others choices for why I make my own afterwards to pretend I hadn’t chosen to fuck up my brain and hadn’t chosen to ignore the actual situation and instead with awareness of their bad state just worsened things.  Even if they didn’t do the best things to me, I never did the best things to them and it’s so genuinely delusional, I know this is no longer talking about drugs but my life circumstances when I’m using these substances has remained consistent, I was originally fine after the fake tab, then I heard of him still cheating and it only worsened my destroyed image of who they were and I failed to connect their behavior to their mental state and instead convinced myself that they were just plotting horrible shit against me the entire two years,  I spent the next few months (after stupidly trying dxm days after) completely confused on people, reality, and human interaction itself, I was terrified of everyone and everything believing everyone is planning something against me at all times, just projecting my own ability to turn on someone in an instant onto others.  I have severe undiagnosed but self-treated BPD, (all diagnosed onwards) Autism, Bipolar, and OCD.  I am ranting into this void because since I have moved due to family issues, I lack any form of human interaction outside of work, I am incapable of developing feelings for anyone anymore either, every time I start to feel something my brain impulsively finds every single flaw it can till lose any interest, I hate the way I treat people and I hate that I keep using chemicals and worsening this state more and more for over a year, I feel like it’s only been a month since I left them, time is flying past me and I’m scared to lose my parents, I never properly valued the people I should’ve, and even through all of this I just can’t stay sober, no amount of this prevents me from smoking more or taking that new drug without any delay",3,3,2025-01-21 07:17:02,despise part definitely venting real place actual feelings likely find someone understands love drugs love hallucinogens love new chemicals also hate drugs every single way nothing effects ever worth downsides continue build keep new different drugs try never amount times ’ get acclimated new states life changed entirely count stop drugs everything besides weed ’ addiction issue weed definitely original downsides previous posts hppd ’ described downsides still one well handled downside never really majorly bothered visual effects mental stupidity except extreme periods binging weed “ difficult ” quit sense little motivation smoking brothers times ever talk/hangout constantly accessible ’ convenient use also semi-require deal minor arfid major insomnia worsened since ’ started using weed cope stop trying new drugs given opportunity ’ like autistic desire aware of/know everything incapable taking opportunity experience new reality even though every time regret last deep ’ always convinced constant weed pallet mental downsides stem without ever quitting weed long term since drugs ’ really know true ’ scared never regaining full ability process reality thoughts never regaining ability picture things head everything ’ genuinely fucked ’ 100 related fact went extreme argument ex manic episodes incapable understanding situation major inability connect person ever really understood yet desire get accustomed acid total mental disconnect experienced made impatient waiting normal dealer get fucked another made choice buy keep blaming tons people mistakes entirely keep blaming others choices make afterwards pretend ’ chosen fuck brain ’ chosen ignore actual situation instead awareness bad state worsened things even ’ best things never best things ’ genuinely delusional know longer talking drugs life circumstances ’ using substances remained consistent originally fine fake tab heard still cheating worsened destroyed image failed connect behavior mental state instead convinced plotting horrible shit entire two years spent next months stupidly trying dxm days completely confused people reality human interaction terrified everyone everything believing everyone planning something times projecting ability turn someone instant onto others severe undiagnosed self-treated bpd diagnosed onwards autism bipolar ocd ranting void since moved due family issues lack form human interaction outside work incapable developing feelings anyone anymore either every time start feel something brain impulsively finds every single flaw till lose interest hate way treat people hate keep using chemicals worsening state year feel like ’ month since left time flying past ’ scared lose parents never properly valued people ’ even ’ stay sober amount prevents smoking taking new drug without delay

I've had profound realizations while on dxm and I think it made lasting changes in my mindset and how I see the world. That I don't need to have fear of judgement because it ultimately doesn't matter or at least I see it more of a positive thing.

How often can you take Adderall long term without losing euphoria?,"Hopefully getting prescribed again this Wednesday. I do legitimately have adhd but would be lying if I said I didn't like how it feels.

Let's say it is 20mg xr and I am tall and skinny generally in good shape and health. I exercise regularly but don't have the best diet tbh. I would take all the proper supplements.

If it matters summer 2023 I was taking Concerta probably 5 days a week on average for ~4 months and I didn't lose much euphoria, though Adderall tolerance increases faster.

I was thinking alternating 3/4 days a week and taking a one month break once a year and perhaps another few one/two week breaks. 
I am fine losing a bit of euohoria before breaks but want to keep as much as possible long term.

Edit: I only plan on taking the prescribed dose when I take it which should help keep tolerance down.

Cocaine in Australia. What to look for and what to avoid,"Hi everyone and my fellow aussies,

I have been a member of this group for about 2 hours and I am fascinated and also upset by the lack of information people seem to have about drugs they are buying, taking, mixing etc.

My aim for this long post is to hopefully educate some people about cocaine in Australia, specifically Melbourne. 

Hopefully this post applies to more people than anticipated and others can build on this post freely as long as their information is relevant and helpful.

A short disclaimer: I am not a professional in any sense of the word. The information I am sharing may not be 100% accurate and may not applicable to every situation.

Without further ado;

Cocaine in Melbourne (and Australia) is notoriously expensive and bad quality in comparison to other countries where illegal imports are easier and more common. An average price for a 1g “bag” ,as we put it, is around $300 AUD.

The cocaine supply in Australia is mostly controlled by outlaw bikie gangs, which I will dive into briefly, later. 

When buying cocaine, or any drug, it is always beneficial to buy from someone you know, are affiliated with, or have a direct word of mouth review from. It is never safe (but it is fun) to buy drugs from anyone you don’t know.

CUTTERS

Cutters are essentially what people add, or ‘cut in’, to a drug that is to be sold to a buyer. There are countless different cutters than can be applied to all sorts of drugs to make them appear more enticing, more cost effective and general give the buyer a sense that they get more bang for their buck. They can be separated into distinct categories:

- Pharmaceutical Agents
- Stimulants or added drugs
- Harmful substances 
- inert substances (they generally have no psychoactive effects or health implications and are considered ‘clean cutters’)

Pharmaceutical agents generally posses no harmful qualities and are generally common in Australian cocaine. These can include Lidocaine, Benzocaine and Phenacetin, to name a few. The first 2 listed, I will call them L and B, are used in the medical realm as light anaesthetic drugs. If you require a stitches on your finger, for example, and are administered a local anaesthetic, lidocaine is, to my knowledge, quite commonly used. Both L and B share similar chemical properties to cocaine, the ‘-aine’ suffix to the word is due to the fact that they posses an alkaloid group in their chemical structure. So, people use L and B to cut their cocaine because it produces a more intense numbing effect on the nose, mouth and throat. Some people attribute this with ‘good’ cocaine. This can be true, as higher purity levels of cocaine share the numbing effects of L and B, but generally in Australia high level purity is hard to come by, and very expensive, so L and B are used to mimic a higher purity. However, these compounds, L and B, do not posses harmful qualities at the small doses at which they are used. For example, you can buy strepsils with lidocaine in them to help numb a sore throat. You will feel that same feeling when it is used in conjunction with cocaine. The reason I am posting about this is because of price implications of coke in Australia, not because of negative health implications. Generally speaking, this is a safe and effective cutter to be used in cocaine, as it doesn’t poses any major risk to health and can actually provide a more positive experience with cocaine, as people find this feelings quite exciting. 


Stimulants and other added drugs poses a much more significant risk to the health of the consumer AS WELL AS people around them. As I do not know the varied and specific amphetamines added to cocaine in Australia (hopefully someone in the comments can help) I will keep this section brief. Obviously, adding a stimulant to another stimulant is not a good idea. Cocaine and amphetamines behave differently and are classed differently. Speed is a commonly taken drug, and often cut into cocaine. It will make you more alert, hyperactive and anxious most of the time when used with cocaine. It is easy to tell for the experienced cocaine user when amphetamines have been added to the coke, as it is a very different feeling, however to unversed individuals it can be easily mistaken for good quality cocaine. It significantly increases risk of cardiovascular events, as well as anxiety, aggression and dehydration. I will undertake more research and hopefully provide more detailed information in future. Caffeine pills like No-doz can also be cut into bags and produce similar risks. If you take any stimulant, and feel sweaty, dizzy, anxious and have a racing heart it is best to stop taking that drug, no matter how much you paid for it, and seek medical advice. The effects of caffeine, amphetamines and cocaine can be easily confused. If you are unsure, stop taking it. 

HARMFUL SUBSTANCES

Harmful substances used in the cutting of cocaine in Australia can include, but are not limited to, Hydroxyzine, ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine and opioids such as fentanyl. I won’t talk about fentanyl because it, as well as its effects and risks, are well known. I will say briefly that it has been added to cocaine and other drugs to increase the feeling of ‘rush’ one can feel after having a hit or bump, making it addictive but very, very dangerous.

Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine, similar to telfast or Zyrtec in a way, but they use different chemicals in their products. It is sold under the brand name Ararax and vistaril, among others. It is added to cocaine for its sedative effects, making the cocaine seem more mellow, allowing people users to not feel as though their heart is racing, among other things. Hydroxyzine is also prescribed for anxiety and sometimes used as a sedation tool before surgery. It can cause serious health problems for people especially who are already taking antihistamines or some anxiety medications, such as seizures, rashes, and heart problems. Usually though, this does not pose a threat, unless you are consuming large quantities of cut cocaine, in which I would be more worried about the cocaine consumption anyway. This is mainly for people already on antihistamine prescriptions.

Ephedrine however, is much more dangerous to the unsuspecting consumer. It is commonly known as an active ingredient in Sudafed which is used for treating nasal congestion and cold&flu symptoms. There is an obvious benefit for dealers who use this in their coke, as people wake up with clearer airways and feel less congested, additionally, it possesses stimulant qualities. You may have heard the cold&flu u classed as ‘non drowsy’, this is exactly the substance that is used to make it a non drowsy product. Ephedrine can cause irritation and damage to nasal tissue if used too frequently, and can also reduce blood flow to your nasal passages which is detrimental to the consumer as they will absorb cocaine more slowly. This can lead to consumers having excess amounts of cocaine as it is absorbed slower in the nasal passage. Another risk of snorting ephedrine is that it delivers a rapid and intense increase to heart rate and blood pressure, causing more of a rush, and thus a more addictive (and dangerous) experience. Snorting excess amounts of ephedrine can result in life threatening overdose. The scariest part of all of this is that ephedrine is an addictive substance. You may think the coke is extremely good, and will go back to the same guy, potentially increasing your risk of the above listed side effects, which are all linked to prolonged and excessive use of ephedrine.

Inert substances can include cornstarch, baking powder, mannitol, liver supplements, creatine and vitamins to name a few. These substances are essentially harmless and just mean that you get a lower grade purity than what you might expect. You could pay for 1g and end up with .3 of that being harmless cutter. Not terrible for you, great for the dealer. 


I would also like to add, that some people report smelling gasoline in their cocaine. This is generally not a bad thing. It is a process called ‘re-rocking’ and is common. In my experience, people have done this because customers like buying a rock of coke, rather than a suspicious white powder. People who buy pure MDMA or ketamine will understand similarly that most people prefer to buy in crystal form and then smash it up themselves. Pun intended.

The point is that every bag you will buy will be different. Suppliers supply your suppliers supplier and so on. Maybe you just did get lucky and get some high purity cocaine, but especially in Australia, make sure you know what you are buying. Cutting drugs is a problem worldwide and I hope that this information will be help people be more informed about the cocaine they are buying. If you would like to add anything, or even critique my post, please feel free to do so in the comments. 

I want to end by making it clear that I am not a professional in any sense of the word, but what I am posting about is well informed and I have had experience with most of the listed cutters. I also do not take any responsibility for the misuse of cocaine or other drugs under the presumption that what I have posted about is inapplicable to one’s situation.

Robotripping in an eating disorder unit,"Robotripping in a eating disorder unit

So on saturday I went on a pass with my mom, basically I get to leave the unit for a few hours. I wanted to get a Buzz lightyear (dont judge me) so I said hey Ima run into target and buy it rq. She was cool with it and I did get my buzz but I pocketed a regular bottle of delsym and a small bottle, equivelent to 240 mg (plenty for me as I'm 90 pounds) 

when I got back to the unit I waited until 9:30pm and  i downed the shit then fell asleep til 4am :( woke up to the most intense robotrip of my life and spent the next two hours scrolling on reddit, listening to music, talking to my woody doll and freaking tf out about what im gonna do when the nurse came to do blood pressure at 6:00 am. I was preparing for what I was gonna tell my parents, preparing to get shipped off to the pysch unit, etc etc. 

came up with the idea to act like food poisoning got me from popeyes the previous night and when she opened the door I was FREAKING OUT internally however I just kinda mumbled I feel super sick and I needed water. She said oh dear and went to go get naseau meds and water, luckily she didnt turn on the light to see me all cracked out. When she came back I had composed myself and used all my effort to say that I'll be okay but I couldnt shower this morning and she said she would let me rest after blood pressure which requried me to stand. So i wobbled up out of bed like a dying old man but she didnt even notice. 

Like a dumbass I asked to use the bathroom and she said yea thats fine and I freinkansteined my ass outta my room and down the hall holding on to the railing for dear life. Had the most relieving piss of all time and felt so safe in the stall, no one could get me there. and after looking at my dxm battlescared face I wobbled back to my room and collapsed into bed, unable to comprenhend how I got my ass outta that situation.

 But I wasnt outta the woods yet. 

Got called for breakfast at 7:45 and I hellen kellered my way to the dining room. When I say i had no appetite I mean I had to fight every bite to keep it down, but I didnt wanna vomit and risk my electronics taken away or bedrest. So halfway through I apologized to everyone one for looking like shit and not being talkative (im usually a bundle of joy) it probabky sounded like ""sorqy eberyvody i lok lik A ragqamufin 2day I aM sper seck"" (try to decipher that if you wish) somehow the dumbass staff couldnt tell and breakfast ended at 8:15. At 8:30 they called me for meds and again I limped my ass to the med room and the nurse couldnt tell at all, I even asked if I look sick and she said nah. My friends, (2 other patients) both said I look and sound drunk and they said I was definitely on something as a joke. Pretty much rode the trip out til 1:00 pm and just made everyone watch all the toy stories all day.

Ketamine is pretty big in my city right now, and people on the internet always gas it up. I’ve tried ket twice and I just don’t understand the appeal.

was i right to narcan her? ,"was at a local rave and noticed an acquaintance i made friends with earlier in the night was slumped on a couch in the corner. at first i thought she was taking a trap nap, normal. but others had mentioned they were also watching her, and that she hadn’t moved in 20 minutes- yet nobody checked her. i first tried to let her know i was there by rubbing her knee and move all the hair from her face but she wasn’t responding. shaking her, yelling, moved her head to an upright position, and a heavy sternum rub wasn’t working; she wasn’t responding to anything or anyone. i gave my narcan to the person she was there with who administered it and within minutes she was thankfully upright and responsive. 

i guess the only reason i’m questioning it is when she woke up she looked offended at us and said “but i’m not on opioids??” i’m not sure if she was using any other substances throughout the night, she said she hadn’t. she left shortly after in the care of others. was i right to let him narcan her? 

edit: thank you so much everyone for reassuring me i did the right thing. i realize now i was definitely right no matter what she said when she woke up. i can’t believe i gaslit myself into thinking i may have been wrong in doing it? i’ve carried narcan with me for about 3 years now and have never had to use it until last night. she really scared me! but now i’m confident in taking control should another incident arise.

Meth not even once ..,"
I feel stuck inside my snowglobe world of meth. Time doesnt exist here. Weeks go by with a little chuckle as i struggle to find a semblance of normalcy. Im living in a fucking dirty sandy tent shooting meth and taking ghb jerking off 12 hours a day. My dealer lives and a closeby motel where i walk through the riverlands like fuckin homelees tweaker steve irwin. Trying to act like nothing is wrong with me if i happen to pass a father and son fishing. I text him im 1 minute to his door. He opens it in his bath towel only. He never wears anything else. He has never hit on me. I use the shower and sleep in my musty hobo ensemble sometimes. Its a place to feel normal and find a vein. He is lonely and enjoys my conpany. Everyone else he knows are just clients that come for happy tweaker endings. Thats when i have to leave.

Theres 4 racoons outside my tent as i type this. They are fighting over my garbage. I like to bust out my construction site flashlight and see their eyes scurry off into the void of the riverlands. 24/7 i hear sirens and helicopters. Police station is right across the yonder. Sometimes i hear evil out there in the darkness late at night. People screaming, crying becsuse they lost their mind and they know it aint coming back. This land is plundered by meth rot. Am i doomed to become part of this damned rot?

I shoot about .7 a day. Lumped arms and bruised my arms are figments of what they were. I can tell my mind is starting to harden and crack. My skin is loose like im a elder.I shouldnt be okay with this. How am i okay with this? Getting sober feels impossible after the stimulation of the last 2 months burned into my mind. The trolley and sirens sounds surely will be amiss.
Now i just need to gain the forsight to go to detox.

Tried HHC and wouldn't suggest anyone,"I have to put this down here, the need to write this down and probably to remind myself why I shouldn't try that stuff again.

*So my brother in law is a loyal green smoker, he smokes that stuff. like everywhere and for whatever reason. Somewhere in December he showed me something ""new"" and that was a HHC vape. He said that stuff isn't as potent as the real THC, but he uses it between his weed. To me it sounded like it was some kind of extraction of cannabinoids without the tabaco part. I looked that stuff up and it appeared to be available in shops within my region, completely legal. Purchased one from a Dutch shop and it arrived a week later. Really doubted to unpack it, because of the packaging and warnings, but yesterday evening I was like - yea whatever. I can always toss it away right? Oh yea, I bought it with the consensus it would improve my sleep.*

# First phase

So I gave it a shot. inhaled one time, held it like 5seconds in my body, exhaled. I tried to continue my evening gaming session, but I completely lost control of my mouse, keyboard and my vision was super slow and unfocused.

Felt my heart accelerating and could feel it pound in my upper body. My breathing was out of control, so I tried to control it by conforming me. My mouth became super dry, went to the fridge to grab a can of soda and the sound my fridge made was like 20times stronger than it normally does. It almost annoyed me.  The soda felt sticky and tasted like sugar.

My face started grimacing, by movements were out of control. Walked from left to right with major lack of self-control. Opened the window for some fresh air. Regretful feeling triggered here.

# Second phase (terrible emotional rollercoaster experience)

Sat at my desk, started shaking so hard like it was blistering cold. but I could control it and change the feeling to ""warm"" whenever I started shaking again.

It was too quiet in my room, so opened up Youtube and it was filled with Trump's inauguration, clicked anything and Kash Patel started speeching. It felt like I was there with him and understood him like it came out of my heart.. I'm not into politics, not American, but I was stuck watching this.

My brain spiked like 5 times in this phase. It started overthinking stuff, things I have done wrong came back to mind, stuff I should handle better came to heart and I started to write stuff down of things I need to change in the future.  So by spiking I mean I felt a lot of emotion that build up to a certain point where I tried soothing myself, I started shaking heavily and these feelings flattened after a few minutes. Next it spiked again like a friggin rollercoaster.

Are these emotions normal? I'm always the cool guy without emotion. It's like I was able to see all repressed emotion from the past months... After 45min of intensity I felt my body went into stage 3.

# Third and final phase

This was the phase I was actually expecting. A chill, cozy, comfortable vibe. No worries and ready for a good sleep. It took 1hour to get this good feel like I read everywhere. But I had to go through 1 hour of mental fuckery before feeling this way. It feels too mellow.

For me this HHC product feels like a hard drug and it makes the mind one big mess. My previous drug experience was like 20 years ago. But it's obviously nothing for me.

Think twice before using ""legal"" stuff, I expect this to disappear someday here because of the availability and youngsters using this.",0,8,2025-01-21 11:19:21,tried hhc would n't suggest anyone put need write probably remind n't try stuff brother law loyal green smoker smokes stuff like everywhere whatever reason somewhere december showed something `` new '' hhc vape said stuff n't potent real thc uses weed sounded like kind extraction cannabinoids without tabaco part looked stuff appeared available shops within region completely legal purchased one dutch shop arrived week later really doubted unpack packaging warnings yesterday evening like yea whatever always toss away right oh yea bought consensus would improve sleep first phase gave shot inhaled one time held like 5seconds body exhaled tried continue evening gaming session completely lost control mouse keyboard vision super slow unfocused felt heart accelerating could feel pound upper body breathing control tried control conforming mouth became super dry went fridge grab soda sound fridge made like 20times stronger normally almost annoyed soda felt sticky tasted like sugar face started grimacing movements control walked left right major lack self-control opened window fresh air regretful feeling triggered second phase terrible emotional rollercoaster experience sat desk started shaking hard like blistering cold could control change feeling `` warm '' whenever started shaking quiet room opened youtube filled trump 's inauguration clicked anything kash patel started speeching felt like understood like came heart ..

I did shrooms at 15 with my gf,"We got a quarter of blue meanies she ate about 2-3 grams I ate the rest and this was our first time trying psychedelics, bad idea. In less then 20 mins I feel it, I looked at my left arm and it looked like it moved in VERY low fps. We were chilling and I felt good but then I got scared because I started to loose consciousness and forget what happened just before. I said to my gf we gotta go to my house because I was scared of her parents knowing we were on shrooms my parents wouldn’t be as mad. Thankfully I only live the next street over it’s a 3 min ride on a bike so once me and her got on our bikes and left I was trying my hardest to not give out and fall off my bike. Once we turned onto my road I saw a car and the lights were really weird they weren’t normal I don’t know how to explain it and the houses were elongated but I wasn’t seeing any patterns or any of that, it felt like the road was way longer then normal it felt like we were on that road for like 5-10 mins. Once we got to my house we went to my room and I started sweating everywhere and slurring my speech, i was acting really weird and kept saying things that didn’t make sense and then I got scared because I kept passing out again and I felt like I was literally loosing my mind so I went to my moms room and said “hey mom” she said “what” then she looked at me and asked “what do you need” she took another look and said “what are you on” I said shrooms. The only reason I didn’t tell her as soon as I went in there is because I forgot why I went in there. She came into my room with me and my gf and put on one of those shrooms trip videos on YouTube and after a while of that we turned it off and I kept yelling out cuss words for no reason and I remember I kept saying “drugs? What are drugs. I’m on drugs. Drugs. What are drugs?” It kept repeating for a bit then I started to get violent and I hit my gf in the face I didn’t mean to and idk why I did it I never wanted to but I did and I busted her nose open bad that’s when I went to my parents room because she ran in there and I was worried about her because I just hit her and I didn’t mean to. I don’t really remember what all happened after this but I was told I bit my moms titty while she was tryna restrain me and keep me down I also hit my brother and swung on my stepdad I was fighting everyone my mom said it reminded her of my dad when he was on hard drugs. I also remember thinking my life was stuck in there room and that was my life, I couldn’t say anything except the same thing over and over again, they kept saying h to r same things over and over it was a never ending loop and it finally ended and I woke up a few hours later like 3-4 I think maybe less and felt fine for the most part but my stomach hurt a bit that’s it.

I think 60 mg of codeine is a enough dose for euphoria to a unexperienced opioid except codeine person. ," for example for me I saw all of drug subs person says ""60mg codeine is very low dose its not effwctive for euphoria, that's nothing, you must take minimum 120 mg fır euphoria"" brooo that's bullshit all of opioids has euphoria in therapeutic doses and codeine's therapeutic dose is 15 to 60 mg 4 time a days that's all. for example always I take 60 mg codeine and I feel amazing, yesterday I took 90 mg od codeine and mann I felt terrible, for 15 minutes my right wrist started itching and turned red, red blisters appeared and I felt terrible 3 hours, after 4 hours I take 30 mg codeine and I said ""wooww thats it"" because I felt euphoria, calming and I was sleeping like a baby with 30 mg. I think most of the people in this sub and other drug subs are former oxy or heroin users, so they think that codeine will make euphoria at a minimum of 120 mg. For someone like me who has never used opioids other than codeine, 60 mg is a super dose, and even doses above 60 mg make the vein sick or do not differ much from 60 mg, only the side effects increase most of the time.

what's your brave/inhibition killing/confidence drug of choice?,"Occasionally i'll meet someone who doesn't seem to have any inhibitions or anxiety. It's actually quite rare, though

I used to work in a bar and it was actually fairly rare for a guy too approach the stunning girl with a resting bitch face for example, especially earlier in the night when people aren't hammered. You could tell they'd want too, but they were too shy/nervous/scared/inhibited. These were just 'normal' dudes with presumably 'normal' levels of anxiety/inhibition

Alcohol gives some people the courage (why they call it 'liquid courage' but even that isn't always enough. Even with me, that's sometimes the case)

I've always wanted to be like that. I have a friend who has zero inhibitions

I got diagnosed with ADHD a while back so maybe that's why i've yet to find something better than alcohol??

Vyvanse experience and my recommendation,"Note that i took this stuff for the first time on saturday so probably i dont know shit but so far i learned one thing.
I think you need to have breaks between taking recreational doses.
Took it saturday was feeling pretty good and i know that crossing vyvanse with weed is an insanely good combo for me.
Next time i take this stuff i will defo have some weed stacked up or else i wont take it.
I only had one joint that night tho so i didnt experience what i would crave for with this stuff.
Didnt take any on Sunday(no sleep that night btw because i took it between 9 and 10pm, my dose was 120 mg btw)
Could sleep on sunday till monday morning, woke up at 8 and immediatly took 120 again. And i think that was a mistake because i didnt get the really nice effects from before, it kicked in at around 11 am and it felt pretty nice for like 30 to 40 mins, but after that it was pretty lame and i took 80 mg between 12 to 1 pm.
I didnt really feel that dose at all and started to get a bit more confused.
When i got home i just researched the same stuff about drugs all day and kept searching for the exact same stuff and looking at the exact posts as a few minutes before.
The loop still consists(its 2:30 am rn) 
I have some weed but i really gotta budget here, smoking a joint like every 4 hours and the joints consisting of like 3/4 tobacco.
I took two of the 40mg capsules half an hour ago just because i somehow need to get rid of them and i cant throw drugs away.
I have two left and will be taking them in a few hours and my stomach is feeling pretty weird because i forced myself to eat at like 8 or 9pm.
I noticed that at least in my case, i need a pause from this stuff.
I think my dopamine brain stuff gets fried pretty easily (unlike my seratonine receptors)
My advice would be to have some weed or maybe 2 or 3 xans to achieve sleep on the comedown, make breaks between taking and have someone you can talk to, because i start talking a shit ton when i take stims and i just cant stop like in this completly sensless post, i just want someone to read this i guess because i want some contact to the world rn, feeling super weird but i know its gonna be over in like 20 hours when i can sleep again and dont have access to this stuff anymore.
Monday morning i somehow didnt want to take it but i just wanted something in my system.
I dont even know what the point of this post is i am literally a complete vyvanse noob, normally i dont even take speed or ritalin because in my opinion those stims are kinda ass.
wanted to stop writing like 3 times now but didnt stop

Is anyone else pissed they can never get ahold of actual drugs as an adult and have to try to find weird ass legal ways?,"I'm sick of this man. I've used basically every drug under the sun but due to a lack of access now for 5 years, I've had to resort to all the shittiest legal ways of getting high like benzedrex, phenibut, kratom, etc. Etc. And for years before this I've done hard drugs on bi weekly or monthly occasions, never daily except weed which at least is legal in the state bordering me. 

I do feel drugs should be decriminalized, especially when there's plenty of people out there whove used them responsibly for years. You can't illegalize alcohol because there's alcoholics, same with nicotine or prescription drugs people need. In fact look what it's done, drugs are now dirtier and off the street more sketch than ever. This needs to change man, because these gross legal highs I do aren't anywhere as fun or safe as the illegal ones lol (in pure form). Even for someone like me who uses once every other week or few months.

It's to the point where it's like well... I guess I'm bout to give up on my occasional fun experiences because the government controls my freedom. My only other option is to get robbed trying to ask a random sketch stranger on the street or go breaking bad mode which is an absolute hell no to both.

Taking LSD after over two years,"It's been over two years since I took any drugs. This semester I had a lot going on and had no time to process anything and acid usually helped me putting all my troubles right in front of my face and giving a healing hand to accept and acknowledge them.

I will be dosing in about about a week. I'm planning on doing 300-450 ug of 1P-LSD. I used to take big doses back then (up to 600 ug and once 800 ug) and was wondering wether doing 300 or 450 this time around. I am not searching to have fun necessarily, but more to face my troubles and have them served in front of me on a silver plate.

Why do you use substances?,"EDIT: I have noticed a lot of people mentioning escapism and addiction. Are yall quietly saying I have a substance abuse problem? Or is society broken at the foundation?

I've been saying this at the beginning of almost all of my comments and posts tonight and it feels like I'm overusing the term but alas here we are. 

I would like to preface this post by saying, I am a passionate human being, and i believe drugs are tools, but i am always open for discussion. Even if it seems like I'm coming off intense, I promise I am enjoying the convo. 

Why do you use drugs? I use drugs mainly for growth, but I have learned over the last few years that really every drug can have a place in a persons life. 

For instance, I use lsd for a plethora of reasons, to learn, create, grow, vibe. With lsd it depends on my mood and dose, what I'm doing with my trip. 

Mushrooms I use solely for spiritual reasons. 

I'm still learning what I can use ketamine for, so far it helps me write on low doses, and socially bubbly on moderate doses. I've only had one high dose experience. 

Mdma I find is kind of boring on its own, it feels good and has me feeling mentally well for a few days after a 100mg experience, but mdma's real power is how it enhances certain substances. 

Cocaine is weird for me, it makes me gain control over my thoughts, helps me organize the brain, all while feeling a tad bit tingly. Don't know how I would use it outside of creating art. 

I really want to experiment with heavy doses of dmt, but I think the universe knows I'm not ready for it as much as I want it. 

I wanna hear what you guys do and why you use.

Psilocybin truffles and advice,"
Hey guys, im headed to a popular town  and taking psilocybin for the first time. Obviously there they can’t sell shrooms legally, so the loophole is to sell the truffle or sclerotia. Im going to kokopelli because its reviews are through the roof compared to other shops. My research has lead to me to believe the best, or at least most popular option, is the atlantis type. A few questions;

- is 2-3g dry shrooms equivalent to 10g-15g wet truffles? (Obviously it’s not exact but ballpark)
- does anyone have a good and simple method for making it into a tea? Or any other ingestion methods that limit nausea
- what to be careful of?
- what do you love to do on shrooms!?

Im not well versed in psychedelic drugs, but am very familiar with the come up, peak and come down nature of drugs. I have good reactions to lsd and all other drugs i have tried. Dont need too much info about setting and head space and all that. I am confident in my ability to have a good trip because I am with good people and know what I want from it - to have a fun experience full of laughter and discover a little bit more about the world, be that good or bad.

Ego death on lighter gas,"Hello, I'm 17, and this is my new butane story.

I was in school and had a long break, so I decided I didn’t want to be bored for three hours. I walked 3 km to a store to buy some lighter gas. After I got back to school, I locked myself in the bathroom and started huffing a lot.

I was hallucinating like crazy. The walls were melting, and there was a slime blob stuck to the wall that I imagined was my friend. After that session, I had huffed about half the can. I went back to class feeling numb, dizzy, and suffering from an insane headache, as usual.

The next day, I had some time to kill between two lessons. Since I still had a lot of lighter gas left, I decided to do it again. I went back to the same bathroom as the day before. But this time, it was different. I had been vaping beforehand, so my blood was full of nicotine.

After the first breath, everything turned slightly pink, my vision slowed down, and my visual static multiplied by ten. I could barely see. On the next breath, everything went black for a moment. That’s when I thought I had died because I hallucinated (or dreamt) some really bizarre stuff.

Here’s what happened: I started feeling my heart beating extremely fast and hard. Then everything went black for half a second. After that, I saw a thin torso made of grass standing in a white void. The torso had a hole in the middle with a heart. It slowly fell backward.

Next, I saw a group of people who looked like cardboard cutouts—very simplistic—just rounded torsos with heads floating slightly above them. One of the pieces slowly floated upward while the others sank down, still standing on the white platform.

The piece that floated upward felt like me being pulled from the living realm. Then I was placed on a small hill of white plastic. The view zoomed out, showing a piece for every person who had ever lived and died. Everything turned black, and I stared into a void for around 10 seconds. It felt cold, and I felt exposed, almost naked.

Adding to the surreal experience, I had headphones on, and these two songs played in the background as it all unfolded:

Song 1: Before I entered the black void
https://open.spotify.com/track/1A11EkhULrKRkAMozPbvry?si=b6juRXkuRMeBWp53rnE42g

Song 2: Started right as everything faded to black
https://open.spotify.com/track/3Cedy1dcoKXuqbiXBhtkQ9?si=JXDXLMohRNOiQCkzzF1Iqg


Later that night, I took two more breaths. On the first breath, my vision became pure static, and I saw a shadow figure approaching me. On the second breath, I looked into the mirror on my wardrobe. I saw the same green torso with the heart in the middle, wobbling.

I gasped for air and began hyperventilating, terrified that I was about to die. After that, I stayed away from huffing for about five days.

Today, I decided to do it again because my anxiety was extreme, and I felt more depressed than usual. I took a small dose, and that familiar warm, numbing feeling returned. The minor hallucinations started again, with the walls melting.

After another breath, I saw the green torso overlaying my vision, wobbling. My heart was beating harder than ever. I gasped for air again, not wanting to die from butane in a school bathroom. I shook my head, trying to clear the vision. Then I threw my bag over my shoulder and rushed out of the bathroom. As I turned the corner, I saw the same green torso swish past on the wall with a happy tone, while this song played in my earbuds:
https://open.spotify.com/track/3RUMmwML7ep3viYvV6oqto?si=0b1oGl5QQLmMk-Ouu9we5g

This experience reminded me that life, even when hard, is worth the struggle for the good moments that come along. I don’t want my family to go through the pain of losing their only son and brother.

Even though I’ve had these terrifying experiences, I’m not sure how much my fear will outweigh my curiosity or whether it will be enough to beat this stupid addiction. Please pray for me.

How unhealthy would it be to snort nicorette lozenges? ,"I know, I know, it’s OBVIOUSLY not a good idea from a drug abuse perspective.

Methcathinone (or other piss easy stims) for ADHD?,"Could methcathinone be used for ADHD? I'm pretty confident I could synthesize it with enough time and money from pseudo.

My focalin prescription is running me ~1000 dollars a year, and I'm looking for more affordable options and I don't really give a shit about legality.

If methcathinone isn't good, what other piss easy available stims are? I've occasionally gotten amphetamine from friends who have a adderall or vyvanse script, but their supply is just as limited as my focalin is.

I've heard people say m-cat isn't very strong and doesn't have that bad of a comedown or cravings compared to other cathinones, but people also thought heroin was a less addictive alternative to morphine in 1880 so I'd like other perspectives. 

I've considered microdosing methamphetamine, similar to desoxyn, but I'd have to buy it off deep web since I'm not trusting no goddamn Alabama street meth dealer. This would run me about 60 bucks a year. 

I imagine it wouldn't be much more expensive to make m-cat compared to buying meth because m-cat synthesis is basically just way simpler meth cooking, but idk.

I love cocaine a little too much,"I used to just be an alcoholic. A functioning one, but an alcoholic nonetheless. I moved cities and got into the music scene as a musician where I was introduced to cocaine. I had done it before at parties but the crowd I fell into showed me that coke can be used as a utility to play a show on no sleep and party afterwards.

It's been 2 years that I've done coke nearly daily and honestly it's just now that I'm realizing I'm addicted. Always saw myself as an alcoholic who happened to like coke but I happened to not pick up tonight cause my dealer was out of town. Went and got drunk with some friends tonight, first time drinking without coke in a long time, and it really hit me that I'm not really JUST an alcoholic, I need the coke to get anything out of a night out.

Thinking about micro dosing again...,"Hi guys, so this is a bit of a strange one and I was hoping to maybe get some advice. 

I used to micro-dose speed when I was 14/15/16 (I was working as well as school as well as taking care of my younger brother's. Long story) and it worked wonders for me at the time. Really helped me get through the day n stuff. Gave me the kick I needed kinda thing. But I used to always have a joint before bed to come down a bit. 

I'm now 21, I'm going through a lot of pretty rough things ATM. I work full time (50 hours a week), go to college part time (12 hours a week) and I live alone so there's all the general house chores n stuff. There's also my relationship which is super hard to manage because I'm so exhausted. 
I was considering starting to micro-dose again. Not permanently just a bit here and there. But I'm not sure if I should expect anything different to last time? I also can't smoke weed any more to come down from that. 

I guess I'm asking if it's a good idea to start up again? And how do I come down from it? Since I can't smoke anymore. 

Any advice is appreciated.

Should I try Meth once or leave it?,"So I got my hands on some meth, speed (amphetamine) and mdma via a dealer. I tried speed once and it wasnt for me. Maybe because I took a low dose or it was of bad quality but I think im not sensitive enough for it. I just got a slight high, was awake and not hungry. Its not the same as what people suggest when using Addreall. So I threw it away. Anyways I'm only really in love with MDMA. That warm, euphoric feeling of being close to the world. I usually did it with my friends but they gave up on drugs and dont want to be in that scene anymore. Im a few years younger than them and want to continue my drug life for a while. I usually take half a pill at home, play some game or listen to music and then make my way to a club and party there where I take the other half. Probably like twice in a month, every 3-6 months.

Now Meth is kinda scary for me. I did a lot of drugs, many of them only once (DMT, Salvia, LSD, Mushrooms and many more). I'm not very addiction sensitive. I smoked cigs for a couple of weeks and then one day just stopped and never missed it again. I drank alcohol for weeks every few days and then lowered it to just once every few weeks. So yeah, I can control myself very well. While still being a bit scared of meth, I do want to try it at least once in my life to know what it is. Im also very calm, never had paranoia.

Two issues arise:

1. **Is it worth it or should I throw it away?** I'm someone who needs a net positive. Is it worth it being drunk happy for 3-4 hours and then have a headache and general illness feeling for 2 days? Yeah sometimes maybe. I can survive the MDMA down with ease, just need to sleep more and maybe I'm a bit more lazy for a couple of days but other than that it works. For Meth I read people literally cant function for a week or two.
2. As usual I would start at home with a low dose and then make my way to the club or chill at home. Is that very risky? Did anyone start doing meth alone or shall always be someone with you? Like even if I get someone to chill with me I dont want others to know I do meth because of the stigma. For all of the people I know cocaine is like the craziest thing there is so imagine doing meth.

Pseudo rehab tryout.,"Hello everyone, I have been having issues controlling my use with Pregabalin for about 2 months.

My idea is to go to my grandparents house for about 10-14 days not bring anything except cbd, get my mind off drugs and do manuals labour. With this my tolerance to both substances should lower. 

I’m planning on bringing some melatonin, onlanzapine and Zofron.

I know it’ll be hard, but I think it will be worth it not only for the tolerance aspect but also working on myself through manual labour.

On introducing my lover to heroin,"
“But I’m the one who puts it in my body, not you -“

“Yes, but still, it *feels* wrong.” 

I only murmured those words to her because it seemed like that’s what I was supposed to say. But, to what audience? How did *I* feel on the subject? I don’t know. In reality, deep down, I only wondered, why not? *She makes it cheaper for me…* that has got to be the most selfish, diabolical, junkie excuses ever. 
 
Most people would and should experience shame. It’s not to say that I didn’t… of course I did. Here was a girl that was hard to love, me being so invested in heroin. However, she loved me, so much so that she’d meet me where I was at. I embraced her there, introduced her to the delicacies of heroin. 

If you’ve ever seen the movie *Candy* starring Heath Ledger and Abbie Cornish as a heroin-addicted couple, there is a part where Heath’s character, Dan, says (on introducing Candy to heroin):
  
“I wasn’t trying to wreck Candy’s life. I was trying to make mine better.” 

How much more I understand this sentiment now, than when I first saw the movie in 2021-2022. Back then, I assumed it was flawed logic, rooted in insufferable selfishness. It still is, but there’s more to it.

Those two statements are far more separated than just being a sentence apart… The latter has much more of a kind of weight to it… an odd kind of ‘need’ that just takes over you entirely, than ever before considered. It practically erases the sentiment of the first sentence entirely. 

Yes, I am ashamed. But shame alone isn’t enough to deter me away. I am well-accustomed to shame that I guess I’ve been led to accept myself as a shitty person. It hurts, I don’t like being a shitty person, but that doesn’t matter anymore. 


“One day you will see how wrong this is…” I told her.

“Maybe, but for now we have each other.”

I smiled and looked out the window. “Just no needles for you.” 

Months go by while we maintain this. I overdose on fentanyl for the second time in my life. She responds with “let’s put this down for a while.” I agree. 

I told her to give herself time to feel like shit during the withdrawal process. I didn’t hear from her until I tried calling her and her father answered. He told me what happened. I guess she had a manic episode, and her parents found her in the middle of it, actively suicidal. 

Flooded with shame, guilt, remorse, pain, I looked accountability in the eyes having been trying to evade it for so long. Cornered, I had to take ownership of. 

She calls me from the hospital.

“I’m breaking up with you.” She said. 

“Yeah..  yeah.” I say

“Well it was good seeing you, hope to see you never.” *click*

In all honesty, that’s good for her. I need to admit that. What I did was wrong. Plain and simple. She’s free now and she deserves to walk away and grow from this. 

I’m flooded with a feeling of sharp, painful loneliness. I tell myself “so what? Everyone is alone. This is a feeling no one can save you from.” No, it’s deeper, a sharp reminder of abandonment, a recurring theme. I can only wonder, am I the common thread? How does one respond to this? 

Is it wrong to show myself any empathy in a world that would presumably *not* show me empathy? 
 
How would I defer that isolated logic from insanity?  
 
How would I grow out of a 10-year-old drug addiction without showing myself empathy? Or am I doomed to a lifelong prison sentence of shame?

What drug would be best for a nerf war?,"Basically i had a thought about how awesome a nerf war would be while high, and so i started thinking about what drugs would go best with a nerf war. 

So first off, it's pretty obvious that high doses of anything, especially depressants and dissociatives, are out of the question, and that even normal doses of depressants or substances that mess with motor function would be bad. 

Hallucinogens are a questionable choice, maybe a microdose would be kind of good?? 

Stimulants should be a good choice, running around and blasting people with badass looking nerf guns while geeked sounds fun as hell. 

And finally weed, i'm not sure actually, maybe if the whole game shares a joint(assuming no tolerance) and gets mildly high it might be kinda fun, but definitely not if every player is stoned out of their ass. 

So, what drug do you think would go the hardest during a nerf war?

"Mixed md, ket and weed together and had the most insane time ","I do apologise for how long this is going to be, but I’ve needed to get this off my chest for a while now and also desperately want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience or knows what/ why it all happened. 
Me and a few friends went out and were doing md and k all throughout the night, it’s pretty standard for us so nothing crazy. Anyways, we had a mini afters and all took another pill and did a LOT of k. Once we parted ways I was perfectly fine just enjoying what was going on and having fun. I smoke regularly to help me sleep as I suffer with insomnia so it kind of soothes me. 
Anyways, back to the point! I was feeling pretty tired and groggy at this point to decided to smoke to sleep. What a bad idea that was. I literally couldn’t function for about 3 hours after smoking. I could feel different parts of my body being moved and was just generally hallucinating like I never had before. I’ve always had a love and appreciation for psychedelics and the power they hold, so I know pretty well what a trip entails, even intense ones. But this was honestly crazy, I blacked out after a while and once I finally woke up and came round to it I had a 45 min video of me taking to myself about a lot of stuff going on in my life and was visibly overwhelmed by it all. The worst thing is I could barely understand myself as sometimes it was literally just noises coming out. I noticed in the vid as well that I kept having completely involuntary movements, head shaking/ swaying especially. 
Anyways, long story time over, I do apologise for the length but I literally didn’t know this could happen. I just want to know if anyone has any ideas as to why or if they’ve been through something along the same lines.

Por andar erizo me estafaron ,"Escribo esto para sacar mi estrés y coraje, en mi ciudad es complicado conseguir weed no porque no haya necte si no porque son bien mamones, dan caro, no contestan, quedan mal a la hora de la entrega, piden mínimos muy altos, etc. usualmente le compro a un wey súper buen pedo y confiable en otra ciudad a 30 minutos de donde vivo y ahí es mucho más barata de que 200 un olla muy buena la calidad y aún así no te da codo hacerte unos porrotes bien gruesos (como sé que te gustan fumar y comerte también jaja) y pues siempre compro esos 200 y me dura bastante.
Ya tiene algo de tiempo que no compro y vi como poco a poco se me fue acabando y decidí no comprar hasta que tuviera oportunidad de comprar con el de confianza pero mis visitas a este lugar no coordinaron con nuestros horarios y decidí que es momento de hacer un descanso para bajar la resistencia pero justo en el primer día me agarró la eriza bien cabron y decidí usar un contacto que encontré en un grupo de fb (primer error), ya había hablado con él pero no le había comprado pero ya me daba confianza porque no me bloqueó o se enojó después de no comprar algo y por decirme que sin pedos que guardara su contacto para después. 
Decidí escribirle y me dijo que si sin pedos solo que en su menú al ser primera entrega decía que era transferencia o depósito por valor mínimo de 200, pedí una media onza de la comer regular en 300 (lo más relativamente accesible que no sea tan poco) y me dijo que todo pero negocie que mitad en transfe y mitad en efec y se armó el deal. 
Me pidió captura para que saliera el pedido y después de eso solo me dijo que era una moto blanca BMW y recibí ningún mensaje después d eso, decidí esperar pero nada escribí mensajes después de media hora para saber qué onda y nada, entre mensajes y llamadas decidir darme por vencido 2 horas después solo que no me bloqueó solo no me responde y su última hora es cuando me mandó el último mensaje, pues quedé todo erizo, enojado, estresado y tuve que rascar con una cuchara tuppers donde guardo mi weed y uso como charola para porque tiene mucho kief que se queda pegado y es tan pequeño como para poderlo tomarlo y logré armar un pequeño toque con un poco de tabaco, eso logró tranquilizarme y si ponerme bastante high porque fumé en un top puff que si no lo conocen les recomiendo consigan uno son baratos cool y fáciles de transportar y pues es como darle al bong creo, nunca he fumado en un bong real.

Going solo raving - should I hippie-flip for the 1st time or just roll?,"Hi all! I will be heading to my first solo rave (have been to many raves before but always with other people) this weekend. Originally I just planned to roll on a slightly lower dose than I normally would since I will be alone, but with it being a psytrance day rave I've kinda started flirting with the idea of maybe hippie-flipping, as I've always wanted to try it.   
However, as it would be my first time combining both substances and I will be on my own, I am a little cautious and wondering if it would be a good idea. I have tripped and rolled many times but always separately, and any time I've taken either substance solo I've never left my house. So reddit - am I being silly to contemplate this idea, or would it be a good time?

And if I do decide to hippie-flip, what would be the recommended timing and dosage of both?   
Thanks fam! :)

Did spice give me brain damage?,"I’m about to describe my experience with spice, and the lasting effects from just a couple of encounters which have taken a huge toll on my well being. Please help me if you have any advice to offer.



In 2024, I was just beginning to get into drugs. I smoked weed a few times with my friends and had always had a good time. I took some edibles at parties, which were completely fine.

This lasted until one event - a year ago next week - when I was feeling extra confident and decided to take 2 gummies (200mg of what I thought was D9 distillate, but was told after was K2). This was the worst night of my life. Despite it, I tried it again a week later to hopefully replace my awful experience with a pleasant one and no longer fear it. It didn’t work and only rubbed salt in the wound, leaving me with even more firmly founded PTSD.

Anyway, besides the gradually healing psychological trauma, I’ve developed tinnitus (ringing in my ears) and really weird visual issues which I’ll try my best to explain.

When it’s dark, I get colourful visual snow, and that’s not too bad, but when I don’t move my eyes for about 5 seconds, I start to lose my peripheral, then all the colours blur and merge into one, ending with it going black. It only lasts until I move my eyes, but it’s a temporary complete loss of vision. I also sometimes hallucinate random images which flash up in front of my eyes and slowly fade. The final thing I’ll add is that I’ve had insomnia caused by my heart beating really hard for hours, keeping me awake.

I hadn’t experienced any of these things before I took the spice, and while many things have improved such as the anxiety, insomnia and the tinnitus, the vision problems remain just as prevalent as they were 11 months ago.

I’d be so grateful if someone could relate to my symptoms, so I’d know I’m not alone and whether there’s hope that it goes away.",3,11,2025-01-20 03:07:51,spice give brain damage ’ describe experience spice lasting effects couple encounters taken huge toll well please help advice offer 2024 beginning get drugs smoked weed times friends always good time took edibles parties completely fine lasted one event year ago next week feeling extra confident decided take 2 gummies 200mg thought d9 distillate told k2 worst night life despite tried week later hopefully replace awful experience pleasant one longer fear ’ work rubbed salt wound leaving even firmly founded ptsd anyway besides gradually healing psychological trauma ’ developed tinnitus ringing ears really weird visual issues ’ try best explain ’ dark get colourful visual snow ’ bad ’ move eyes 5 seconds start lose peripheral colours blur merge one ending going black lasts move eyes ’ temporary complete loss vision also sometimes hallucinate random images flash front eyes slowly fade final thing ’ add ’ insomnia caused heart beating really hard hours keeping awake ’ experienced things took spice many things improved anxiety insomnia tinnitus vision problems remain prevalent 11 months ago ’ grateful someone could relate symptoms ’ know ’ alone whether ’ hope goes away

Trip sitting someone trying lsd,"Let me preface, they are not a first time drug user, not even a first time psychedelic user, this will, however, be their first time with LSD-25. 

T;L/D;R : What do I do with someone who has never done acid, has experience with high doses of other psychedelics, doesn't know it's power, but wants to do a high dosage of if, and wants to do it just to have fun?


On Wednesday January 22, I will be trip sitting someone who wants to take two tabs of my acid, which is strong acid. I personally believe it's about 150ug/tab but it was sold to me at 200ugs. Either way, their trip will be anywhere between 300-400ug. 
I use lsd, without getting too into it, because it helps me unravel the shit in brain without a chip on my shoulder, and helps me look into what I want out of my future. I don't exactly remember why I decided that's what lsd was for me, I don't remember if it was lsd or mushrooms, or mdma, or what. 
This person is just as broken as I was/am, and I can see their struggle with their mental health. Their life is currently in a good space and I want to provide a safe place for them to expand their consciousness, and hopefully experience the care that lsd has provided me. 
As off a few hours ago they want to do acid to have fun, to let go, essentially to just try it. 

So, my question is a two part question. 

Should I guide their trip, as 300-400ug is extensive, towards seeing lsd as a medicine, or should I kinda let them vibe, answer questions they have and let's them find it themselves, if they even do? 

Keep in mind I do mean guide. Suggesting ideas instead of enforcing my own ideologies on them.

I kind of fucking hate drugs,"Alot of people on here take drugs quite responsibly, and that's a good position to be in as far as drug use goes. It's a bit of fun, and relatively harmless.

I started drinking alcohol at a young age because that's what my parents encouraged, then at fourteen I started smoking weed and it just kept escalating from there.

I was allowed and encouraged to do drugs as a teen. By my parents. I don't believe I ever went over into extreme drug use for any prolonged amount of time, but any drug use as a tween/teenager is pretty shit.

For example I'd do really dangerous shit, like take 30 + benzodiazapine pills in a single day. It was never for a prolonged period where I became physically dependant on the pills but I SPORADICALLY did irresponsible shit like that.

I have done a robust variety of drugs. As I got older things got more malignant. My parents started using the drug use they initiated against me. I was groomed into taking drugs as a child, so my parents could have ultimate control over me. There was sexual abuse etc... Which had been going on for a while, it just ramped up as I aged and became more dependant on them.

I can't get into specifics but things got really fucked up and dark and I had to leave. I am now living in a council house trying to process what the fuck had happened. I am so bitter about my substance use, I feel forever tainted.

I am taking responsibility for my health now, but it's hard not to feel bitter and manipulated. My drug use was pretty tame considering the dire situation I was in, and I think my health is likely unscathed as I've never gotten into daily usage with hard drugs. 

There where some close calls. I am filled with so much shame, it makes it difficult to move on. To be clear I think drugs like mushrooms/truffles are great, but I hate drugs that can cause dependance because they give malevolent people the opportunity to create ultimate control over another human being.",49,31,2025-01-19 11:57:24,kind fucking hate drugs alot people take drugs quite responsibly 's good position far drug use goes 's bit fun relatively harmless started drinking alcohol young age 's parents encouraged fourteen started smoking weed kept escalating allowed encouraged drugs teen parents n't believe ever went extreme drug use prolonged amount time drug use tween/teenager pretty shit example 'd really dangerous shit like take 30 benzodiazapine pills single day never prolonged period became physically dependant pills sporadically irresponsible shit like done robust variety drugs got older things got malignant parents started using drug use initiated groomed taking drugs child parents could ultimate control sexual abuse etc ... going ramped aged became dependant ca n't get specifics things got really fucked dark leave living council house trying process fuck happened bitter substance use feel forever tainted taking responsibility health 's hard feel bitter manipulated drug use pretty tame considering dire situation think health likely unscathed 've never gotten daily usage hard drugs close calls filled much shame makes difficult move clear think drugs like mushrooms/truffles great hate drugs cause dependance give malevolent people opportunity create ultimate control another human

Evidence of long term effects?,"Do we have a clear picture, that is evidence based, of the health risks or impacts of long term, moderate, recreational mdma use?

I have done a ton of research lately into long term effects of mdma use… digging in hard with sites like MAPS, Erowid, and Dancesafe, then doing endless conversations with ChatGBT. 

Summary of what I’ve found is that, essentially, there is a risk of long term impacts to some cognitive functions like memory…. But we truly don’t know and can’t say with confidence if these risks equal likely outcomes, or just the presence of a risk (however great or small). In particular, with years of use… even with long breaks between sessions. 

I’m asking this while understanding that everyone’s bodies are different, life styles are different, and that it’s hard to answer this question with extremely high levels of confidence or precision. 

Still, I’d love to know if I what I found is broadly, generally true. Why? Because mdma is fun and I’d like to continue to do it occasionally… and I don’t want to fuck myself up (so, please avoid the predictable “safest thing is to not do it” line. That is obvious and goes without saying).

Evidence based answers are very, very welcome.

Has the amount of coke related posts in this subreddit increased or am I just forgetting things?,"Seems like every other post is about some teenager getting addicted to coke or trying it once or twice and saying how shit it is

Coke is definitely addictive and pretty normalized in western society, I’d steer clear if you can due to how quickly it can become habitual. It can be fun every now and then but some people have addictive personalities.

If you are addicted or have issues I would STEER CLEAR if this subreddit.

How I (18F) fell into a coke and meth addiction ,"So I'm here to share my experience and want any advice or questions. To start, I'm 18 F. Last summer I was smoking weed and drinking a bottle of whiskey a week straight up since I had access to it at the restaurant job I was sous chef at. Eventually I figured something had to change because I was depressed and drinking and driving so I found a new job hoping it would be a fresh environment for me to get sober in. I was still smoking weed but for a good month I wasn't doing anything else and felt great. 

Then in October that year I got in a wreck. Car was totaled, I was fine overall besides some deep glass cuts in my face and being sore from the impact. But after the shock wore off i was in a lot of pain and had a concussion so I started picking up the bottle again to sooth it. Again I fell into a depressive state so it's not surprising that I went down the path I did. Someone I knew from school showed up in my life again and I did cocaine with them even though I said in the past that I wouldnt do anything other than weed but I figured ""what's one time, right?"" 

Because of how tired and drained I was, I could tell I was going to get hooked on it instantly. It came at the right place, right time and fixed my problems, uplifting me. I told my friend that I'd only do it on special occasions but knew that wasn't going to be the case. I started doing lines everyday. Right when I wake up, before work, mid day, and anytime I could. It wasn't just the feeling that I loved, it was the routine. Sneaking off to the bathroom or a private place and cutting up that shiny white powder into lines and gumming the excess.
I also liked not needing to eat and not having an appetite. I thought it was a waste of time and I felt better when I didn't eat more than once a day (also looked really good which is a plus haha) 

I'm kind of rambling at this point but anyways I was worried about the effect on my nose so I started a nose routine. I felt great but I knew that I would have to quit at some point because its expensive and eventually despite whatever self care remedies you use, the consequences will catch up to me someday. And you know how dealers are, they can be unreliable and hard to get ahold of so I would get irritated if they weren't responding. I started doing some searching when he would respond to find someone else that I could buy from for the moment. The guy I got in contact with ended up selling meth instead of coke. I'm surprised at how little I actually thought it through but I was like ""well since your here anyways I might as well try a little bag"". So I crushed up the crystal and snorted it like I would snow. For me personally, I'm not as much of a fan (I do it regardless but you know 😅) 

My family is not stupid and has been noticing signs in my behavior these past few months. One minute I'm upbeat and chatty and the next I'm withdrawn. Ill go out late and stay out the whole night when I have to work the next morning. My dad had me take a drug test and I knew I was fucked. I showed for THC, meth, coke, and amphetamines. He told me I need to start going to rehab and if I'm not clean in 6 months I need to find someplace else to go. 

I find i feel grosser when adding meth to the mix. I sweat a lot more than coke and just the other day when I woke up and got out of bed, I blacked out and hit my head. I'm having to eat more now because if I ate the same amount I did when it was just coke, I would be rail thin. I'm not quite sure how I got here. This time last year I was COMPLETELY clean, no nothing. I was really mature, made good decisions, and cared more. Now I hardly can feel at the same capacity. I'm numbed. I sometimes don't really care what happens to me and wish I never survived that crash. I mourn the way I used to be and have broken every promise I have made to myself. I can't trust myself. Now I'm bitter and even when I'm in a good mood I'm always saying something negative in a sarcastic way. I slowly push people out of my life and wind up feeling lost.

I want to quit and know I should because I need to make a change in my life. I need to start focusing on my future instead of my next line. I need to save up my money. I need to repair my relationships with loved ones and myself. It feels like I will never get out though because like before, I've broken my trust over and over so I can't be sure that I will ever actually quit. My eyes becoming soulless... It's crazy how just a few months can totally change you. How addiction is no joke and will take hold before you even know what's happening. I'm not saying I don't enjoy it still but I wouldn't suggest that anyone start like I did. Although I do feel like things were a lot better before the meth. Coke alone was just fine and I think I was made for it, a functioning coke addict if you will. I never smoked the two of them though, I won't go down that route but I guess you know know what addiction will do to you.

"I made an herbal ""drug"" resin","I’m a big fan of herbal smoke / herbal tea that can get you “high”. the big issue with a lot of these herbs is that they don’t really do a whole hell of a lot on their own. however, through various experiments of making blends of herbs for smoking and for tea, i can definitely say that when you mix the right things together you can get some relatively potent effects. that said, i’ve always kind of wondered what using extracts of these plants would be like, if you could create an even better effect out of it. So i finally decided to go ahead and try.

i did a pure water extraction, simply boiling the following list of plants for about an hour before straining, pressing, and dehydrating in the oven.

lemon balm leaf - approx 10-15g

chamomile flower - approx 10-15g

skullcap - approx 5-10g

lavender flower - approx 10-15g

mulungu bark - approx 7-12g

valerian root - approx 7-12g

california poppy - approx 10-15g

wild lettuce - approx 17-22g

rose hips - approx 28g\~

indian warrior - approx 2-5g

gotu kola - approx 17-22g

kanna - approx 2-5g

wild dagga - approx 20-25g

damiana - approx 40-50g

in my experience most of this stuff is rather sedating/relaxing with two primary exceptions kanna and damiana. i didn’t weigh anything out beforehand nor did i know exactly how much i had left i just sort of threw everything i had into a pot and let it rip. if it comes out decent i’ll try another one with more calculated inputs.

The end result was just over 2oz of leathery/crispy resin, like literally 56.xx grams. i tried one test capsule size 00 but i didn't feel anything because i'd also done 3 capsules of kanna and had a cup of coffee around an hour or so prior. Will experiment tomorrow with nothing else in my system for a proper test, and i'll likely try a few grams of it all at once to see how it goes.

Edit: 

Update: i tried smoking it last night and then again today. last night I put it in my dab rig with some dabs and it doesn't really burn the best in there, but it does produce a noticeable difference to dabs by themselves (and I have a pretty complex mix of cannabinoids that I use that differs significantly from plain D9 dabs). today i decided to roll up a blunt, used a gram of wax around the inside of the shell, then layered in some hemp, then a stripe of the hardened plant resin in the center of the hemp, with more hemp layered on top. i've smoked about half of it so far and it is without a doubt stronger than weed by itself. the initial rush of smoking and the high are altered, there's like a weird buzzing behind your eyes in your brain. it's like weed+",3,7,2025-01-19 23:50:04,made herbal `` drug '' resin ’ big fan herbal smoke herbal tea get “ high ” big issue lot herbs ’ really whole hell lot however various experiments making blends herbs smoking tea definitely say mix right things together get relatively potent effects said ’ always kind wondered using extracts plants would like could create even better effect finally decided go ahead try pure water extraction simply boiling following list plants hour straining pressing dehydrating oven lemon balm leaf approx 10-15g chamomile flower approx 10-15g skullcap approx 5-10g lavender flower approx 10-15g mulungu bark approx 7-12g valerian root approx 7-12g california poppy approx 10-15g wild lettuce approx 17-22g rose hips approx 28g\~ indian warrior approx 2-5g gotu kola approx 17-22g kanna approx 2-5g wild dagga approx 20-25g damiana approx 40-50g experience stuff rather sedating/relaxing two primary exceptions kanna damiana ’ weigh anything beforehand know exactly much left sort threw everything pot let rip comes decent ’ try another one calculated inputs end result 2oz leathery/crispy resin like literally 56.xx grams tried one test capsule size 00 n't feel anything 'd also done 3 capsules kanna cup coffee around hour prior experiment tomorrow nothing else system proper test 'll likely try grams see goes edit update tried smoking last night today last night put dab rig dabs n't really burn best produce noticeable difference dabs pretty complex mix cannabinoids use differs significantly plain d9 dabs today decided roll blunt used gram wax around inside shell layered hemp stripe hardened plant resin center hemp hemp layered top 've smoked half far without doubt stronger weed initial rush smoking high altered 's like weird buzzing behind eyes brain 's like weed+

LSD: freedom or losing who you are?,"I often hear people describe how they feel freer after trying LSD—how they’ve gained control over previously intense emotions or experienced profound personal growth. These stories often highlight newfound perspectives, deep emotional release, or a sense of connection to themselves and the world around them. I’ve only tried it once when I was very young, but I don’t remember much about it, nor can I say how (or if) it changed me at all.

What intrigues me is the range of experiences people report, from breakthroughs that feel almost life-changing to subtle shifts in how they relate to their emotions or thoughts. However, I can’t help but wonder if this sense of ""freedom"" comes at a cost. My question is: has LSD ever made you feel more disconnected rather than connected? Did it leave you feeling unmoored from yourself or your emotions?

I find it difficult to believe that a single experience can fundamentally change, heal, or ""cure"" a person. While the idea of transformation appeals to me, I can’t shake the worry that my scepticism might prevent me from fully embracing the experience. I also question whether the effects are genuinely as positive as they seem or if they come with risks that people don’t often talk about. Many of the stories I’ve heard make it seem like people become a bit ""out of it""—as though they’ve traded clarity or stability for a sense of novelty or detachment. I’m afraid of potentially losing parts of my character, experiencing depersonalization, or feeling more fragmented rather than whole.

At the same time, I’m curious. Do you genuinely feel that the sense of freedom you experienced deepened your personality and brought you closer to your authentic self? Has it made you truly happier and more fulfilled, or do you think the effects are fleeting, even superficial?

I’m not trying to discredit anyone’s experiences—I think personal growth can take many forms, and everyone’s journey is unique. I just want to make an informed decision for myself. LSD seems to hold the potential for something profound, but I don’t want to dive into something that might compromise my sense of self or leave me feeling untethered.

I’d love to hear your honest perspective, whether your experience was positive, neutral, or even difficult. What would you say to someone like me, who is both curious and cautious? What, in your opinion, makes it worth trying—or worth avoiding?

**P.S.** I’m fully aware that trying to heal character flaws or traumas solely by taking drugs isn’t a healthy approach, and that’s not what I’m aiming for here. I’m a recreational user, and I’m simply curious to know if stepping into psychedelics could be an interesting or (especially) enriching experience.

First Time with Triple-Pressed Blue Punisher – Advice?,"I’m planning to try a triple-pressed Blue Punisher this weekend, but I’m feeling a bit cautious about it. I’ve read reports online (like the one I’ll attach here) that say these pills hit really hard, even for experienced users. Some people mentioned amazing euphoria, but others talked about throwing up or feeling overwhelmed by how fast and strong the come-up was.

I’ve done MDMA plenty of times before, but mostly in crystal/rock form since it’s usually purer, and I know what I’m getting. Pills are trickier because they aren’t always just MDMA – they can have other stuff mixed in, which makes me nervous. I’ve tested this pill, so I know it’s MDMA, but I still want to be careful. For context, I usually roll around once a month.

For reference, I’m 16M, 5’9, and about 50kg, so I’m pretty lightweight. Normally when I roll, I do around 400-500mg throughout the night, but I never take it all at once. My usual routine is double-dropping 100mg (200mg total) to start, then spacing out the rest over time.

My first time doing MDMA, I ended up taking 500mg in crystal form. It didn’t kick in for about two hours, so I kept taking more, thinking it wasn’t working. Then, out of nowhere, it hit me like a brick, and it was the best feeling I’ve ever had. I’ve learned to space my doses since then, but that experience still sticks with me.

With this pill, I’m not sure how to dose it. Should I take half first and then the other half 30 minutes to an hour later? Or would it be smarter to start with a smaller portion and wait longer? I definitely don’t want to overdo it.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s tried these or similar pills and what worked for them!

Took 500mg of dimenhydrinate or how ever u spell it by accident ,"M15 So I’m sitting here typing this not knowing what to expect because I took 10 gravol pills with no knowledge that they can make you hallucinate up until a few minutes ago when I started feeling weird and I looked it up 

I have no idea what to expect I’m just worried. I took them from 9:15-9:45 and just kept popping them because I needed to sleep quickly I had no idea that that there’s negative impacts of gravol, turns out there are and u can see shit apperently.

I just want to know what to expect because I’ve done other hallucinogens before: shrooms and lsd. I have no clue what the expect and I just wanna know what I should expect it doesn’t feel like much right now only a little weird but that’s it, also how long does it take to peak.

Thinking about relapsing on benzos ,"So for context I was addicted to Xanax for several months and was able to quit them finally around 1 week ago and never ever had the desire for them since.

I’m thinking of buying acid tabs any advice before I try?,"I’ve tried shrooms before and I had a good experience, but at the end of the trip when I tried to sleep and I couldn’t I started stressing out, I recon I’ve learned from that mistake, I also took a re-dose half way through the trip which I definitely shouldn’t of done.

Pregabalin works better than benzos even stims for me now.. can somebody please explain to me why?,"Long story short, been sent to a mental hospital and a sort of camp that punish kids for being no good kid they forced me to take all around 6 months of anti-psychotics.

At first the dosage was 150mg it seems working, I knew 150mg was small dosage for people who got huge benzo tolerance like me, so I slowly added up to 600mg, and THIS IS IT, all the pain, GONE, and for nearly 4 months, the tolerance didn’t add up, with or without benzos. And it gets rid off my headaches after I smoke. I been on these things for 2 more years now, and this is the only final drug that works and doesn’t have any side effects.

Gabapentin and Klonopin ,"Hi all - quick question (I’m aware you are not medical professionals but seeking opinions from others who may be on this or have insight)

Heavily unfocused at work. I’m always focused on my thoughts instead. What drug can help with that?,"Hi, M22 here.

Basically, most of the time, I’m about 80% lost in my thoughts and 20% focused on what I’m actually doing sometimes even less. I could literally sit still, not talking for hours, being entertained by my own thoughts, enough to keep me from getting bored.

At work, though, instead of staying focused on the task, my mind goes all over the place. Like, “What if my boss falls off the roof and breaks his neck—would I call an ambulance or drive him to the hospital since we’re so far in the woods?” “I really need to fix that throttle delay in my car.” “Running down the avenue 🎶 see how the sun shines brightly in the city…” 🎵”

It’s constantly like that. 

Outside of work, it doesn’t cause any major problems, other than me thinking about things more than actually doing things - so less productivity.

For context, I’ve been like this since I was a kid, it’s nothing new, it’s just that, like yeah, I know how to do the job well, but since I’m never focused, I’m throwing away potential in improvement.


Anyway, enough with the talking. 

What drug could help with being focused at work, (completely focused if it’s possible) and keep my random thoughts away?

Adderall is BY FAR the best pound-for-pound substance created (in my opinion),"Yes, you caught me. I started my adderall journey (responsible bender) 2 full days ago and i have not slept since. I feel great, i felt even better when the adderall was actually in effect considering i took five 10mg IR pills. My strategy was to continue to take a 10mg dose when i started to feel the crash coming from the previous dose.

Interestingly enough, the last dose i took was probably 12 hours ago and im totally fine. Heart is a little bit tight considering i did have a energy drink and did also run 13 miles 2 days ago, when i started this adderall journey.

So, with that being said, i have tried almost every stimulant out there and i can confidently say adderall has probably 5x leverage over my previous favorite, cocaine. 

For me, adderall can play 2 roles amazingly well. When i took the first 10mg dose, i did some work for my business with incredibly more efficiency than any other compound i've ever tried. I felt very capable   and the work i was doing felt more important than ever (in a positive way), meaning i felt i was putting more effort into tasks than i have ever done before.

Phase 2 of this adderall journey (bender) was when i took the second 10mg dose. When that dose started to kick in, i was still able to work, but my focus shifted towards being social. i was on the phone with friends for 3 hours before we decided to hangout. Without getting into too much detail, throughout the course of 12-15 hours i took three more 10mg doses. I had some of the best conversations i've ever had, in my life. I almost had a 3 some. I did end up getting some action from one woman in particular who i have never hooked up with before. I had moments of silence in my head that i totally accepted.  

I doubt this post will be cleared but if somehow you are reading this, just know drugs are NOT A SUBSTAINABLE VENTURE! They will ruin your life. I have a great relationship with drugs because i 1.) earn them ( good month of business) ( fitness goal accomplished ) etc, and 2.) i undersrand, respect, and acknowledge these god-given compounds for who they are and what they are capable of.

Craziest MDMA hallucinations? ,"What are your craziest stories? I usually go pretty wild when I smoke weed after MDMA. 

The first time it happened, I saw a dog running across the dance floor, and it hid under a bench. There was an older lady behind it, I assumed it was its owner. I went there and asked “Can I pet them?”. She was looking at me hella confused, there was no dog at all lol. 

I also teleported many times to my office while rolling on raves. I was fucking frustrated with my tasks, literally searched for a pen and always switched back to reality with a big “woah, what the fuck was that?”

My craziest time was MDMA + weed. I smoke a lot on a comedown with my friends, then I felt a sudden pull down and I was stuck in the sofa for the next 3 hours. Try to keep myself in reality, I did not understand the space, the time, the objects in the room made 0 sense to me. I couldn’t recognise my friends, and I heard as if they were talking gibberish. Everything started to melt and I tried to count the cabinet doors to keep in touch with this world. The music got so loud i felt like i was going deaf. Quite literally astral projected or idk.

"Different trips from the same dosage of weed, is there an explanation.","Hi all so here's my story,  I recently just had a bad trip on weed (25mg) basically very anxious and worries, feelings of my heart basically liké it was going to burst from thé intense feelings, basically pure panic and bouncing from thought to thought in my head in a bad way. Ended up getting a friend to help me through the worst of It before it died down after I had a nap and woke up hours later.

But now I can't shake how different it was to my prior experiences on the same dosage only 3 weeks prior and every time before that where is has been a fun, giddy, melow wave or being distarcted and going back and forth in my head in a good way.

I'm curious as to how is there such a difference when I can't disern a cause from my mood or behaviour or diet, anything, perhaps my day not being the best in terms of being a little nervous but even then It wasn't bad, especially when it took the dose. 

It leaves me worried to trip again out of fear of having the same thing happen even though previously this has never happened. I know weed can have multiple effects but this caught me off guard so any guidance as to why this happened/happens or how incan avoid it would bé apprecaited.

Did i have a k-hole on my comedown of of molly? ,"So is was doing Molly with some friends at night a while back. It was a cold winter day so we just chilled in my living room. I heard about that, if you take a low dose of ketamine at the end of rolling, that you would have a much less bad time afterwards. I think i took like 30mg of ket at first, then because i felt so little i took another 30mg. This was at the end of the roll. So like 4-5 hours in. 

Suddenly i felt something wierd like i am suddenly on acid but i can’t move . We had one of these laser projectors and i saw a fucking guy in the center of the red laser walking down red stairs. suddenly i just foccused on him everything else became blurry. 

My friend suddenly came ot the bathroom and was saying stuff like „bro what the fuck just happend my eyes are like bowling balls. Dude you look so fucked up.“ „Bro you look like a crazy scientist.“ he starred at me a looked back than we laughed. 

So now time was like not important anymore i just laid there for what felt like an etwrnity and watched the red man walk down the stairs. 

Then suddenly i got down very chilled and me and my friends went sleeping. And idk why tf but i had no molly hangover whatsoever. Also the psychedelic experience wasnt bad it was beautiful.  Ket shortly after the peak of molly is crazy like you suddenly for only 30 mins or so you where on like 20 tabs of lsd. 

I knew ket could go pretty hard tried it after a 20 hour lsd trip once. But that expierence with molly and ket was on another level. 

So what do you think k hole or just strong ket molly combo?

How am I supposed to recognize alcohol poisoning when drinking solo,"
Okay so I'm asking this in the name of harm reduction because I'm not trying to die so I want to understand how to recognize when I need medical attention. 

Most days I am just maintaining a buzz but some nights I will drink everything in sight until i finish eveything, on these nights as youd imagine i usually get pretty fucked up. I usually black out but im usually just vomiting until I lose consciousness. Before i get to that point its just normal shit like slurring my words, having blurry vision and not being able to walk properly. 

But my question is, how am i supposed to know if i have alcohol poisioning? I had alcohol posioning before in the past but someone else noticed it and called an ambulance for me, but i live alone now so i dont know how im supposed to recoginze it in myself especially sense im usually fighting to stay awake. Does anyone have any advice on signs to look for or any tips on staying safe besides from the obvious?",13,8,2025-01-20 20:49:47,supposed recognize alcohol poisoning drinking solo okay 'm asking name harm reduction 'm trying die want understand recognize need medical attention days maintaining buzz nights drink everything sight finish eveything nights youd imagine usually get pretty fucked usually black im usually vomiting lose consciousness get point normal shit like slurring words blurry vision able walk properly question supposed know alcohol poisioning alcohol posioning past someone else noticed called ambulance live alone dont know im supposed recoginze especially sense im usually fighting stay awake anyone advice signs look tips staying safe besides obvious
Cocaine/Ket Nose/Infection/Damage Help,"Hello,

CURRENT DRUGS / ROI

Ket 2 years, coke 4months, 2 months very low dose street ""xanax"" (like .25 a day, I know im addicted i know its still serious)

Symptoms:

Tried to quit ket in worst way possible with coke binge,  Now for lat 4-5 months been daily user of both.  Ket way down, one gram a day at most, some days  a half, bladder seems a little better but stlll need to get up 3 times a night, but everything else drastically worse.  Up to 2-4 grams of coke daily, in a few short months the damage to my nose is almost unimaginable to me given my past history. I never, even with heavy heavy use, had body issues this severe that I remember.

SYMPTOMS:

A year or so into ket started getting the usual there, bladder pain., reduced bladder volume, etc.  Also around that time I developed a very unpleasant body odor which has progressively gotten worse, cant describe almost like im moldy. Also loss sense of smell. Ket use was high.  2g a day.   Some days I was almost at 5.

Now for lat 4-5 months been daily user of both.  Ket way down, one gram a day at most, some days  a half, bladder seems a little better but still need to get up 3 times a night, but everything else drastically worse.  Up to 2-4 grams of coke daily, in a few short months the damage to my nose is almost unimaginable to me given my past history. I never, even with heavy heavy use, had body issues this severe that I remember.

Massive infection, I have bloody nose almost all day long even when not doing lines, this disgusting absolutely putrified smell coming from my nose of like sewage, I am blowing out these huge viscous, sometimes bloody but not always things prob 50 times a day.  Some of them very large, they are unlike anytihng I have ever seen or dealt with as a life long sinus sufferer/.nasal drug user.  It doesn't seem like coke boogers, doesn't feel like them, idk its gnarly, usually accompanied with large amounts of blood, sometimes I feel like i am blowing brain matter out lmao.   My nose seems to be rapidly deteriorating nostrils are collapsing in , collage gone.  Wake up in the morning with incredibly painful crusted over nostrils  protruding out with disgusting red or yellow like organic hardened blobs i have to use saline to dissolve so i can breath. Smell keeps getting worse and worse, and so does my body odor, I feel like i am decaying  Nose is like covered in a slime that is very sticky.  Burning sensation in sinus on one side of face usually once a day that is unbearable, for an hour so, feels like a lit cigarette inside my face, eye goes deep red and tear ducts wont stop.  Joints hurt, hair hurts, recurrent UTIS.  General stupidity, mixing up words. confusion, rapid mood swings.  No real fevers but either in cold sweats or flop sweets always/

TREATMENT

at beginning i used an almost full script of leftover CIPRO antibiotic i had lay around and started doing saline rinses multiple times daily.  The amount of stuff that comes out on a daily basis is so alarming.  Weird thing is i almost never have a fever but constant headache, cold swears etc.i

Went to ER one night when pain was unbearable, they didn't really listen once i said drug user, doctor touched my nose and said I had lost a lot of structure, did a ct scan which thankfully didn't show any major damage to septum and they said no massive hidden infection, but did, confirm sinus infection gave me amoxicillin and sent me on my way.  However they didn't run any blood tests and I really don't feel like they were hearing me on the severity, or maybe just thought I was delusional coke head.  I have been a delusional crackhead, 15 years ago I was bathing daily in enzymes to kills bugs lmao,  I don't think it is that, coke doesn't have the same psychotic kick for me meth and crack do lol.  I was happy to hear results, but something didn't track.  Amox i felt much better on it, but day I stopped I was horrible again.  Got a doxycycline script today i am about to start after a week trying to rough it.

QUITTING

I am working on stopping, have tried many times.  I have asked for time off work, I am so far behind on projects and have had such poor/inconsistent performance that I think I will prob be fired regardless, but they asked me to get my projects in and then I could take two weeks, i told them personal issues but I am sure they know, luckily I WFH and am a coder so mostly solitary, but have been so sick even trying to do that near impossible.

BACKGROUND::

Not new to addiction, heroin and crack for 5 y in twenties (3 yrs **Intranasal**, 2 years IV/**Crack** **Inhalation**),  sober 7 years after, relapse =>  2 years meth (**Inhalation**)  => 8 years sober, can't remember ever being this sick I was always one of the lucky ones in that way, and no major damage, despite severely high usage.

HARM REDUCTION

Like an idiot i continued to use a  disgusting bloody dollar bill for months.  I wasn't really breaking up the coke and ket that well, was just usually credit card w little effort.  Was really depressed and saying fuck it.  Now I am trying to do better and using a straw.  Daily saline sinus rinses, with spray or neti pot

Is this even trying?

I’ve tried to do one day off and one day on and that works for a few days and then I dive back in.

Career Advice,"Hi everyone! I’m in need of career advice, and I’m hoping it’s okay to post here. I’ve been working in harm reduction for 4 years, and I have never loved anything more. The community I have found in harm reduction is wonderful. That being said, I’m getting burnt out with trying to work within the systems that claim to follow harm reduction principles, but actually don’t. I’m currently working at an overdose prevention site, and I LOVE the work, but my manager is terrible, and has zero fundamental understanding of harm reduction. 

I want a new job, but I want to stay within harm reduction. I live in Canada, in an area where progress is slow going. I have my undergrad degree in Social Justice, and my Masters is Social Justice and Community Engagement, with a focus on mental health and drug use. I would love to work in harm reduction research or policy, but there doesn’t seem to be any job postings I can find related to that in my province.

Looking for help. IV use advice and how to do it properly. ,In the past I was a homeless IV heroin user. Learned it all from someone I knew at the time. And I did what I did. When using heroin it would usually black tar sometimes powder I would always use a cotton. That's how this person who taught me taught me how to use it. My question is if I'm getting back into IV use and trying to do it safely I need advice. He taught me to use the filter butt of a cigarette as a cotton. I'm not currently IV heroin but am doing so with O-DSMT and cocaine. Is the use of a cotton still necessary? I'm basically wondering do i always need a filter or cotton or not? The O-DSMT dissolves quick and easy and so does the cocaine so is it really needed? Also if it is needed what filters or cotton should I really be using? Basically I'm asking how do I IV a substance safely and what are the steps. When dealing with things that readily dissolve in water what's the point of a filter? Just trying to stay safe as possible and yes i know many of you will discourage me from going back to IV because it's a slippery slope but at the end of the day I'm my own person who is gonna make my own choices. The only way you can help me is by at least offering harm reduction advice. I'm dealing with stuff that dissolves in water easy. Why is a filter needed? How do I do this safe and right.

Harm Reduction Doulas ,"Just want to throw it out there , for any pregnant and parenting persons using drugs, Harm Reduction Doulas Coalition founder Carra Wetzel-Chubb has made a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching the basics of what you need to know when supporting a pregnant person that uses drugs, or being a pregnant or parenting person using drugs. I know a lot of these things are probably specific to Washington State when it comes to the laws and things like that, but it's pretty universal information that can be super helpful weather or not you're a doula. Again even if you're just a support person to a pregnant person using drugs, or you yourself are a pregnant and parenting person using drugs. I think these videos can be extremely informative and helpful and answers ALOT of questions were scared to ask for ourselves.

Any 3.2 abv beers still exist in Colorado? ,"I really like to drink quite the amount of beers when I'm socializing. But a lot of these beers now they got like 5% and 6% alcohol and some even more than that! I just don't have that kind of Tolerance anymore and I always end up more drunk than I want to be because as I'm socializing I tend to drink a bit more quickly than a lot of people. I guess I just get thirsty lol.

Now, some might say I should just stop drinking but I simply don't want to. So I thought maybe I would switch to 3.2 beer but I'm having a hard time finding any anymore. I guess another option might be to mix regular beers with some kind of mixer? So I'm open to ideas for that as well. Cheers.

What you need to know when using injectable narcan.,"NEEDLE NARCAN PSA

So I just want to say that even though I am a recovering heroin addict and used intravenously, today when I had to narcan someone, all I had available was the injectable narcan. For the life of me I couldn't get the narcan into the syringe. Luckily someone else was able to , but I contacted the other harm reductionists in my circle, and everywhere they've been seeing people OD and die with narcan available because people aren't knowing how to use it right. Apparently you have to pull the plunger back before you insert the needle into to the vial to create a vacuum , or you won't be able to draw up the narcan. Just recently my best friend/ harm reduction doula saw people on the side of the street trying to inject narcan into someone ODing andd they wasted several narcans trying to figure it out so she pulled over broke the needle off and sprayed it up there nose because better some narcan than none. Just thought people should know this before they're out into a situation and don't know what to do.

Hallucinogenic Dope?,"Hey guys. Not sure how much I can share about where I am so I’ll just say a big city, east coast of the USA.

I recently relapsed after a failed relationship and some other stuff and ended up throwing in the towel.  Stupid me I regret it so much. Anyway, one of the first bags I used when I initially picked up again was very weird. It made me feel like I was getting tunnel vision and weak. I felt like my blood pressure was dropping to the point I might pass out. Now, I’m 21 years old and in pretty good shape so my blood pressure dropping isn’t normal at all. But this particular stamp made me very anxious, and my field of vision looked like how “pins & needles” feels when your legs fall asleep or something. I hope that makes sense because that’s the best I can explain it. 

I go back a few days later and grab a bundle of a different stamp. This stuff was so weird. It did the same thing, except I remember sitting in my recliner in my apartment looking at the ceiling thinking “what the fuck is in this shit?” Because I was literally tripping as if I ate 4 grams of mushrooms or took too much LSD. Closed my eyes and the visuals got very intense. Kaleidoscopic tunnels that were turning and changing colors etc. only thing though, this wasn’t a pleasant feeling. My head felt pressurized like it was about to pop, throbbing headache, legs felt like jello and couldn’t walk, anxiety through the roof, etc.

There was a few other instances but you get the jist. I thought it was a reaction I could be having or this was an incident isolated to just me. Well, one of the last times I went to cop, I met this really nice girl and offered to buy her some candy and a drink. As we were walking talking and eating, she asked me if had the dope that makes you trip yet. I was shocked and relieved that I wasn’t crazy lol. 

Then a day or two ago, I go down to cop from the normal spot I go to now and there were other addicts outside waiting because they ran out and it was gonna be 10-20 minutes until they got more. One of the guys I was waiting with said that he dosent trust any other block because other dope makes his legs weak and makes him hallucinate! 

So clearly this is something contaminating the dope supply. 
1- I’m sharing this to bring awareness and let yall know to be careful 
2- I’m wondering if anybody knows what this substance is that is now in our dope?
Really just looking for any information on it as I really am curious as to what it is.

"(Long Post: Interactions Welcome Welcome 🙂) Drug Addiction is LITERALLY a Brain Disease and Harm Reduction/Education Should Be Medically Un-Stigmatized, and prohibition should be ended and resources used towards Mental Health, Rehabilitation, and Harm Reduction.","I did not believe addiction was a ""disease"" until I recently studied it, I thought we justified and rationalized our drug use to be selfish, and that u should just be able to use ethically. When you do something like Methamphetamine (Cocaine produces a huge release of dopamine, from 100 units to about 350 units, and Normal Brain is 0 to 30 pg/mL, just so you have something to compare to) it will release dopamine that can be about 1000 units. This is insane, your brain will immediately recognize that from that dopamine release, this drug is more important than Food, Water, Shelter, Sex.
Like to your brain it literally needs it to stay alive, since it's your Survival Chemical. Same thing for drugs that effect your serotonin (besides very specific outliers such as psychedelics that just simply won't work after a certain number of times double dosing) your brain literally recognizes that you NEED this chemical to be happy. Not want. Like dopamine and serotonin deficiency's can make humans Lose hope, Turn Suicidal, or move into a abandoned house with other almost less than human scavengers to get more of it, lie to their families, risk overdose, ect. This is not normal behavior, because addicts aren't normal. This is an extreme example but would you not give someone w/ Extreme Delusional Depression their SSRIs... NO!! Cause the risk it causes is death, or someone w/Neuropathy their Gabapentin, also no, “Substance Abuse” is a Mental Condition as well, your brain chemistry is changed. That's what causes behavioral differences, so it needs to be treated but as long as we criminalize Harm Reduction Abilities and the Mentally Ill, this will never get anywhere, abstinence has such a low rate for success... and drugs has beat the United States Government in its own war.. technically twice if you count Prohibition
Not a single person has ever died @ a ""Safe Injection Site"", Testing Centers make sure your putting what YOU think you are in your body, and “Clean ROA Clinics” hand out  sanitary Gear, makes it more sanitary.. how can this be bad, especially in bigger cities... replace the $$ givin to fund this war that lost before it started, and give to Rehab/Outreach Programs. You'll see a Change you Never expected, or @ the very least give people hope. You wouldn’t blame someone for having OCD or Epilepsy, try to see it as the same, if able to be treated/safer than we should study/educate yourself as much as humanly possible, look @ the overdose rates, or just look down the worst streets @ the life’s these chemicals have ruined. Not one of these people as children said “oh I can’t wait to be a drug addict and sleep in a tent, developing hallucinations that make you lose your mind”… like be so for real.

This is getting long so l'll stop here, just try to look @ different options.. using marginally, in the safest ROA to your health, hygienically, staying hydrated and educated.

Is there life threatening danger in mixing alcohol with muscle relaxants?,"I've been wondering about the potential effects of combining Norflex pills (orphenadrine) with alcohol. Orphenadrine is as a muscle relaxant which seems to affect nerve endings and induces a sedative effect on the central nervous system.

When these substances are mixed, would I become sedated or could there be more severe consequences like respiratory issues?

How can I help my liver stay healthy while struggling with alcohol addiction? ,"Does anyone have any tips for keeping your liver and overall body healthy when you suffer from a drinking problem? I have intentions to quit in the new year, hopefully. I’m working up the courage to speak to my doctor about it but I have been really worried to do so due to him being quite judgmental. I have no idea what the state of my health is at this point because I have yet to bring it up at any appointment ever. 

I’ve been drinking heavily every day for 2 years straight now, some days worse than others but I am definitely drunk every day. I know the ultimate thing to help me will be to quite entirely but I am not even sure if it’s safe for me to do so on my own at this point, hence why I am ultimately working up the courage to ask for medical help. In the meantime though I really do want to anything I can to keep my liver and overall health from any lasting damage. I’m scared there already is some. 

I drink electrolytes if I feel hungover, I try to stay hydrated in general. I try my best to eat healthy and I get a decent amount of exercise due to living in a city where I can walk most places (also because I don’t ever drink and drive. I walk a lot)   

I’m just wondering if anyone has any other tips or things I can do to be taking care of myself as best possible while I work through this. Any herbs that can help? Maybe probiotics?  Any specific foods?  I know there’s a plethora of health issues that can arise from alcoholism but the liver is the one in the most worried about as I did have a family member who had liver failure due to alcohol.

Weird Experience - Confused and Concerned ,"Last night I took a very low dose of shroom tea, under 1g (just made at home with leftover shrooms from my last trip so I’ve taken them before). I also took my Wellbutrin (300 mg) earlier in the day. I went to a concert and everything was fine for the first hour and a half/ two hours. I drank like half a beer and took a few hits of a spliff but nothing crazy. We went out to get our jackets and I suddenly felt completely nauseous and passed out on the floor. I was going in and out of consciousness and couldn’t stand up or see. The venue people got me into a chair and I went unconscious again but my eyes were open the whole time, I felt like I was heavily sedated. About an hour later I was sitting at a bar eating some fries and I passed out again at the table. 

My question: would the combination of things cause this?? I’ve taken shrooms probably 10 times and never ever had anything like this. The only difference this time was the Wellbutrin but it was so weird. Wondering also if this seems more like I was roofied but I never left my drink unattended and no one tried to hit on me or anything so not sure when that would have happened. Super confused.

A Simple Guide To Recrystallizing MDMA For Harm Reduction,"Got those Downtown Doo-Doo Brown Molly Blues again? May I present:

# A Simple Recrystallization of MDMA from Hot IPA

… or …

# A Simple Guide To Kitchen Chemistry Recrystallization of MDMA For Harm Reduction

The Merck Manual lists MDMA hydrochloride as a ""bright white crystalline salt"". Btw, just real quick: you know that's what we're actually taking whenever we ingest ""MDMA"" ☞ we're actually taking MDMA hydrochloride. Many other drugs and pharmaceuticals are in fact in HCl salt form, like e.g.: cocaine, ketamine, MDA.

So you may be inclined to purify this product on your own, using your own means, & in your very own kitchen, either to achieve higher purity or to amuse your friends… or even just yourself. Right, so here's how to clean out some of the non-amine-bearing impurities

by:

                |                 |           ,---.       |    
    ,---. ,---. |---  ,---. ,---. |---  ,---. |___/ ,---. |---.
    |---' |   | |     ,---| |     |     |   | |   | |   | |   |
    `---' `   ' `---' `---^ `---' `---' `---' `---' `---' `---'

(Note ☞ IPA = isopropyl alcohol, rubbing alcohol. However, the stuff from the pharmacy is usually 50% - 70% IPA, the rest H₂O. You cannot use this 70% IPA; it has to be 99%+. Search around the Interwebz for a source on this; it's not hard to find, but no sources posted here, please.)

**STEP 1** » Procure three glass jars for canning with straight-opening mouths. You want quality glass jars that won't break, so aim for a well known brand to protect your Balls.

    Good Jar =  
    ____________  
    ;          ;  
    |          |  
    |          |  
    |     √    |  
    |          |  
    |__________|
    
    
    
    Bad Jar =
      ________
     (        )
    [          ]
    |          |
    |     X    |
    |          |
    |__________|

**STEP 2** » Pour IPA into one & cover it but not too tightly – as it warms, the IPA will expand & you don't want pressure building inside a sealed glass jar. Place this in a bowl of warm water.

       ____________
       ;          ;       
       |          |  ———————— Jar w/ IPA
    ___|__________|___
    \                /
     \              / ——————— Warm water bowl
      \ __________ /
        ==========

**STEP 3** » Bring pot of water to boil. If using an open flame, keep IPA in a different room. Turn off heat & let cool 1 minute or so – don't wanna break any of those glass jars with sudden temperature spikes.

seeking advice/ clarity,"hi guys,

i am in my early 20s and recently started working nightlife, i am familiar with substances and general harm reduction but new to the nasal route. 

i’m seeking advice to prevent as much physical damage as i can (septum deviation, etc) as well as important aftercare.
 
socially 1-2 nights max weekly, amount varies but generally doesn’t exceed the equivalent of 3 lines (usually less) 

conscious about switching nostrils, use a netting pot to flush out any debris afterward as well as try to take hot showers/ inhale steam. i also use a thin layer of aquaphor to relieve dryness if necessary.

to this point i have not experienced full on nose bleeds but i do sometimes have some residual bloody mucus 24-48 hrs after (tmi lol)

i’m aware this might come off stupid and i do apologize, i’m growing paranoid navigating this alone and am hoping for clarity on long-term harm reduction practices.

i have only been around 0 tolerance family or heavy users so the black and whiteness of it all is distressing. 

thank you for reading, if you have any tips or suggestions around the topic please reply, everything is appreciated :^,)

( TLDR: new to nasal route, any and all harm reduction & aftercare practices are appreciated !!)

EDIT

just wanted to say how greatful i am for all of you in this thread, i feel much less alone/ paranoid now that i can interact w likeminded people who value harm reduction vs paranoid google searches

Harm reduction question,"What is the safest dose of both Norco and Pregabalin combined together, before I risk serious CNS depression.

In a lot of pain and I cannot fall asleep on top of suffering from severe insomnia that has had me up for 3 nights. Will start with the safest dose of both combined people suggest, remember I am trying to sleep through my pain not fucking die. And hopefully my insomnia won’t keep me awake after using the safest dose of both people suggest, because along with both drugs I also have an HHC pen that tests at 91% if that also occurs.

How sustainable is daily cannabis use?,"Long story short: 'over-the-counter' cannabis vs prescribed trazodone

I'm recovering from a long term illness, and I use cannabis semi-medicinally. When I started, I tried to keep it to 3-4 times a month, essentially using it in place of lorazepam for acute anxiety. I have easier access to cannabis since it's legalized for recreational use [Canada]. And let's face it: I feel much better on cannabis.

I've had sleep problems most of my life. I take 12mg trazodone every night for sleep. I've been at that dose of trazodone for 8 years now, and it's fine. But lately, I've been using cannabis almost every night. A 2mg THC/6mg CBG gummy is my current dose.

I occasionally use 5mg–10mg THC recreationally, which is why I say I use cannabis *semi*-medicinally. I limit my recreational use to once a week at the absolute most. I tend to stick in the 5mg–7mg THC range for rec use, but I have used up to 10mg.

Additional HR strategies I have in place: I don't use cannabis before 8pm. If I've had <3mg THC, I don't drive for at least 12 hours. If I've had >3mg, I don't drive for 16 hours. When I use cannabis, I don't take trazodone. If I'm using a recreational amount, I let my partner know first.

I just had surgery, so I used that to experiment. Maaaaan, trazodone gives me fucked up dreams. I never realized before because the options were either fucked up dreams or no sleep. I was severely mentally ill when I was first put on trazodone lol. And cannabis also helps me with nighttime irritability whereas trazodone just helps me sleep.

I have a wonderful clinical relationship with my doctor, but my cannabis use is the one thing we disagree on. She's rightfully worried about risk of worsening anxiety with long term use. I don't plan to stay on cannabis forever. It's a tool that I'm using for my recovery. I feel the benefits are outweighing the risks, but I'm worried I'm not being objective.

Do y'all have any thoughts on this? Are there any additional HR strategies I should put in place?

Do some people NEED to do drugs/alcohol sometimes?,"I have been thinking about this. 

There seems to be a certain amount of addicts out there that literally just can't/ won't quit substances even though the substance(s) have destroyed their life. I know a few people, including myself.

I'm 34M and I can say my life has been destroyed by several substances. However I can't/ won't stop, entirely. I can take breaks, reduce the amount and practice Harm Reduction. 

I struggle with whether I can't or I won't quit the substances. It's like what came first, the chicken or the egg?

If a person has profound mental suffering, and has tried to abstain from the substance(s), and still suffered profoundly, and the substance(s) also have legitimate benefits that can be harnessed if the person learns how to 'control' their usage, then why is being abstinent from all substances still the #1 treatment? 

I get that some people literally cannot control their usage however I don't believe this to be true for all addicts. I think this is especially true for people who have endured profound trauma that doesn't respond to things like therapy or antidepressants or whatever. That doesn't respond from being completely abstinent.

treating alcohol like other drugs,"been a while :)

have run into some obstacles regarding alcohol harm reduction (not necessarily the validity of tips, rather my consistency in following through).

my bf whom i love so so much sat me down gently yesterday and talked to me about alcohol use and moderation. this was after a night of nothing catastrophic but me definitely being more drunk than necessary

he said that me being especially drunk makes him anxious which honestly is a big driving factor for me wanting to moderate not just more consistently but always

especially as he said he didn't really care about seizures (i don't have TCs, it normally just looks like i'm shaking, and they usually happen the morning after. and also they happen like every day w/o alcohol anyway 😭). it's just what's in my control that i should . control

anyway what relates to the title of this post is how / the sort of plan we devised to concretely space out drinks etc

it's very similar to how we space out when doing other drugs (coke namely comes to mind) - very careful dosing time and listening to ourselves . it def takes some self-discipline but i think it will help

we discussed a certain issue - thankfully, as i believe i'm now over it - that even the people we've taken this approach to, say, coke with do Not approach alcohol this way. my bf and now i are, it feels, pretty unique

i wonder if that's because drinking is so normalised? over-drinking? idk. if anyone has any observations let me know lolol

i feel less weird after talking to him this time but it almost feels like i'm putting restrictions on this social activity because of this system i'm observing now. but also.. for my bf's sake (and mine i guess. idc about myself much though) it's so worth

"Injected month old blood- what should I do, how fucked am I? ","Registered a shot but couldn’t hit and decided to empty it into a 2ml centrifuge container to use whenever I ran out of my supply, either to boof or boil off and smoke in a pipe. It’s been 3-4 weeks and I ran out of a couple days ago. Wasn’t even sure about boofing old blood just sitting in a container for a few weeks, would’ve done some research beforehand. But after taking 6mg of Xanax today I ended up filtering the blood through some 70% isopropyl soaked balls of cotton, and repeated a couple of times. Had added 25 units of water with all the residual powder of ice I could collect so the blood was slightly diluted and stronger  to some degree. Added a couple units of isopropyl to the syringe and stupidly slammed it. I’m extremely cautious when it comes to iv admin, I can’t believe I did that even barred out.

 I rubbed in triple antibiotic ointment beforehand, prepped with an alcohol pad, put a bandaid with a little bacitracin zinc added to it, slight pressure for a couple of minutes, and then took bandaid off 10+ min later, wiped the area with a piercing aftercare cleanser and am in a dry circulated room. Been 2 and a half hours since, no iv site reaction at all (very rare for me) and feel fine/no signs of problems. Took a bunch of vit c and zinc, folate, multivitamin, and NAC , as the only precaution I could really do by myself. 

I asked ChatGPT how much risk I’m in and how likely am I to be ok, and it basically told me I was fucked. I’d like to hear from people in here though who have actually done shit like this, know of or have experience with doing what I just did. Am I in critical danger? Could I end up being fine? Or is that highly unlikely. No one knows I’m an iv user and I’ve never had any complications or infections before. If I feel completely fine should I still seek medical attention? Are there places I can go where I can do this discreetly?

Help w needle size,"Hi, good evening folks. I am a therapeutic ketamine user who can no longer afford expensive treatments. I’ve got myself a few grams of what I think is pretty pure ketamine at least that’s what the test said it was. I also have in my possession some 28 gauge needles. I am completely and experienced with doing any kind of self injection, but I’ve seen a few YouTube videos and it seems fairly straightforward. If you file the steps and good hygiene the reason why I want to do the occasional intramuscular injection is because for one you get more out of here ketamine like twice the amount of sniffing as I’ve heard so that will not only save me money, but also help with wear and tear on my body. I think that’s important because I’ve been in regular treatment for a year or so. Just wondering if anyone knows if a 28 gauge insulin needle would work for my powdered ketamine. I’ve had great results with this medicine and I’ve had a two month break. But I can feel my mind getting really funky and I do not want the SI to come back so if anybody can help me with this here, I would really appreciate it thank you and have a lovely evening.

The best extraction method for codeine/paracetamol?,"Let's assume resources are no problem. I'm familiar with CWE, but is there an optimal way to do it that removes maximum paracetamol and minimum codeine? Or is all CWE basically the same? I also wondered if maybe there was a different solvent or technique that might work better?

If possible I'd also like to know of any way to test how much paracetamol and/or codeine is in the final product.

Thanks in advance!",4,3,2024-11-22 04:42:56,best extraction method codeine/paracetamol let 's assume resources problem 'm familiar cwe optimal way removes maximum paracetamol minimum codeine cwe basically also wondered maybe different solvent technique might work better possible 'd also like know way test much paracetamol and/or codeine final product thanks advance

My relationship with IV meth use (at least at this point) is not compatible with me living in an abstinence-only environment. I left my home (in part) due to it being such an environment. Living on my own, I have maintained an (imperfect) environment conducive to safer-use (clean needles, alcohol pads, sharps box, tourniquets, etc. \[there are a few more items I feel I should have, but I have the basics, and it's better than nothing.\]). Unfortunately, I do not foresee myself being able to go back home, but it is not unlikely that at some point I will cohabitate with someone who does not approve of drug use, and I would like to be able to provide a thought-out alternative to an abstinence-only environment. I know that only I know what is right for me, but it would help me to get others' opinions, experiences, examples, etc. to the following questions:

1. What items should I be permitted to keep at home to promote safe usage without encouraging overall usage at home?
2. What items should I be permitted to keep to promote safe usage for when I use outside the home (and where should I keep said items)?
3. Should I advocate for an environment where I am permitted (but not encouraged) to use at home as opposed to an environment where I am permitted (but not encouraged) to use only outside of the home?
4. (*This one I know is deeply personal, but others' experiences might help me understand what is best for me.*) Should I keep some product available to me? I'm leaning ""no"" as it would provide constant temptation, but it would prevent last-minute sourcing from a potentially bad source, and I would not be compelled to do it simply because an opportunity pops up, as I would be able to tell myself that I could do it another time.

I am now scared of drugs...,"I consider myself a responsible adult drug user.  
I use test kits and even have some fentanyl test strips.  
I am not abusing my drugs.  
That said, I have started getting scared of drugs recently.

The fentanyl lacing possibility has started freaking me out.  
I read that it can be potentially found in any powder form, i.e. cocaine, speed, even in my beloved ketamine. 

Yea, I know I must use the test strips **always** but I read that fentanyl distribution may be uneven...and you may get a negative result for your sample  but there could still be fentanyl in some other part of your batch...and testing your whole batch is impossible.

So I have been trying to replace most of my drugs of choice with pharmaceutical or legal versions of them and have a peace of mind.

e.g. replace cocaine and speed with Adderall. 

What's your thoughts on this? Am I overreacting? Any other suggestion for enjoying my drugs safely?",16,27,2024-11-12 21:33:27,scared drugs ... consider responsible adult drug user use test kits even fentanyl test strips abusing drugs said started getting scared drugs recently fentanyl lacing possibility started freaking read potentially found powder form i.e cocaine speed even beloved ketamine yea know must use test strips always read fentanyl distribution may uneven ... may get negative result sample could still fentanyl part batch ... testing whole batch impossible trying replace drugs choice pharmaceutical legal versions peace mind e.g replace cocaine speed adderall 's thoughts overreacting suggestion enjoying drugs safely

Life is so better,"I’m a chronic alcoholic if I drink just a few drinks and get that glow I won’t stop until I have to be medically detoxed but I have had detoxed at home that was hell on earth. Anyway I haven’t had to goto medical detox in over 6 years but 3x I took a drink only once did I get really drunk and thankfully I had enough benzos for the morning that my wife forced down my mouth so I wouldn’t take that morning drink or else all bets are off. The last 6 years I have been with the same job which is 5 years longer than any other job and I’m 52male. I’m prescribed 3mg of klonopin a day and 800mg 3x a day gabapentin and I use Kratom multiple times a day. My wife also is prescribed Xanax that she doesn’t use often so I always have back up when I run out of mine and she will give me 2mg just for fun once a week. I didn’t think I was going to get my klonopin refill for a few days so she gave me 10mg of Xanax to get me thru but my pharmacy called and said it’s ready today so I went and got it and popped 8mg Xanax took 3mg klonopin and have good smoke from dispensary and I’m in lala land but still very alert cuz I have such a tolerance. I’m just going to say I don’t care what your drug of choice was there are many ways to escape reality without the drug that would ruin our lives.

Seeking Advice on IV Cocaine for the First Time—What Should I Know?,"Hi everyone, I’m thinking about trying a very small dose of street cocaine IV for the first time. I've used buprenorphine this way, so I know how to inject safely. This cocaine isn’t very pure, and it’s been in a rolling paper for about two months. I’d like to know:

1. If it’s safe to mix it with water and inject it without additional preparation.
2. What I should watch out for in terms of health risks, especially related to heart issues or overdose.
3. Any tips for someone who’s only familiar with injecting buprenorphine, not stimulants like cocaine.

If helpful, I can upload a picture of the product. Just looking to understand the risks and anything critical to know.""

Question about daily use of etizolam or other benzos,"I've had the same bottle of Etizolam in pg solution for 6 years.  I take it no more than twice a month, only for playing shows and occasionally at home on a weekend so that I can just feel normal and deep clean my house without freaking out about it.   I've been doing this for six years without much deviation, it's just a set of rules I use so as not to even get close to addiction to it.  

I know that benzo withdrawals are some of, if not the worst out there.  This is another reason I've always been so strict about my use.  I took it three days in a row one time at the very beginning, just very small amounts, and my sense of impending doom was through the roof by the fourth day.  I knew then and there that I'd be using it extremely sparingly.

But lately I've been considering taking them more often.  When I'm on it, I feel what it's like to not be constantly worried about something and/or myself.  I feel what it's like to live a kind of normal feeling life, where you're not overly happy about stuff, but you're also not completely overwhelmed with worry about anything and everything all the time.  I always think, ""this must be what it's like for people without clinical anxiety.  I'm just kind of taking care of business and doing what I need to without thinking too hard about it.""

I've been seeing a therapist for years, I've tried various anti depressants, and nothing works in any substantial way.  I'm pushing 40, and for as long as I remember, I've felt like life is barely worth living.  

So, finally, my questions are -  is there any way taking etizolam often won't just ruin my life?  And if I take it more regularly, is there anyway to try to combat the rebound anxiety that I'll surely experience? (I get rebound anxiety even after my one or two times a month, because my brain is so prone to anxiety).  I know there are people out there who are prescribed daily benzos, which doesn't make sense to me because taking them daily, wouldn't you just have to keep increasing your dosage for them to maintain efficacy, and to keep rebound anxiety at bay, eventually maybe plateauing?  

Sorry for rambling.  I'm just at my wit's end with my life, and I have this drug that makes me feel like I can function normally, and I want there to be a way that I can take it more often so that I can enjoy my life.

Pink Cocaine… Seriously? [PSA],"In recent weeks I have seen a flood of social media content regarding the death of a singer I had never heard of (Liam Payne), almost invariably with reference to a concoction generically called *pink cocaine*. 

For me, the name conjures the image of a lightweight girly version of coke. Sadly, it’s nothing of the sort. Let’s take a quick look at what seems to be an in-vogue craze.

https://preview.redd.it/q9l039e9gozd1.jpg?width=3247&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee0b9c9abeae6ce6b6ab9fa7f9a19611e28c8f0c

Wikipedia will tell you that pink cocaine (aka tussi, tuci, tucibi) ""*contains a mixture of different psychoactive substances, and is most commonly found in pink-dyed powder form*"". 

That *mixture* is neither defined nor consistent. Although it commonly contains drugs like ketamine, MDMA, meth, and cocaine, there is no agreed or universal recipe. Different vendors will sell pink cocaine which contains radically different drugs. 

Straight from the bat you can see a serious safety issue. Without deep testing of the actual contents of your supply, you are in the dark, and are taking a significant risk. Even ignoring your exposure to an unknown combination of classic drugs, which in itself could be severely problematic, it could easily contain fentanyl, or perhaps some relatively unknown research chemical with a similarly dire safety profile. 

Here's another issue: even if you do know the actual contents, you are unlikely to know the ratios. In other words, you don't know the actual doses of each constituent drug. This too is a serious accident waiting to happen. 

So… right here, without going any further …. you don’t know what drugs you are taking and you don’t know the doses you are taking them in. This is like spinning a roulette wheel with some of the numbers equating to tragedy. 

If anyone reading this is foolhardy and reckless enough with their lives to still proceed, here are some tips:

* Establish the real contents. Test your supply!  
* Try to establish the ratios and err on the side of caution re dose.
* Research the dose thresholds and harm reduction info for each constituent drug, perhaps using a resource like the *Drug Users Bible* or *Erowid*.
*  Adopt a more formal harm reduction process. For example, by following ‘*The 10 Commandments of Safer Drug Use*”.  [https://drugusersbible.org/content/drugscape/safety\_first/the\_10\_commandments\_of\_safer\_drug\_use/index.html](https://drugusersbible.org/content/drugscape/safety_first/the_10_commandments_of_safer_drug_use/index.html)
*  Take a VERY close look at the *TripSit* combination chart. Heed the contents (see the *10 Commandments*).

A better tip?

Don't take it. If you are going to take a drug, identify the specific outcome you actually want and select the specific drug to deliver it rather than taking an unknown combo.  

VENDORS: Please really think twice if you sell this stuff, or at the very least, honestly specify the actual contents and ratios. People are clearly getting into serious trouble, and worse, with it.",33,14,2024-11-08 13:22:16,pink cocaine… seriously psa recent weeks seen flood social media content regarding death singer never heard liam payne almost invariably reference concoction generically called pink cocaine name conjures image lightweight girly version coke sadly ’ nothing sort let ’ take quick look seems in-vogue craze https //preview.redd.it/q9l039e9gozd1.jpg width=3247 format=pjpg auto=webp s=ee0b9c9abeae6ce6b6ab9fa7f9a19611e28c8f0c wikipedia tell pink cocaine aka tussi tuci tucibi `` contains mixture different psychoactive substances commonly found pink-dyed powder form '' mixture neither defined consistent although commonly contains drugs like ketamine mdma meth cocaine agreed universal recipe different vendors sell pink cocaine contains radically different drugs straight bat see serious safety issue without deep testing actual contents supply dark taking significant risk even ignoring exposure unknown combination classic drugs could severely problematic could easily contain fentanyl perhaps relatively unknown research chemical similarly dire safety profile 's another issue even know actual contents unlikely know ratios words n't know actual doses constituent drug serious accident waiting happen so… right without going … ’ know drugs taking ’ know doses taking like spinning roulette wheel numbers equating tragedy anyone reading foolhardy reckless enough lives still proceed tips establish real contents test supply try establish ratios err side caution dose research dose thresholds harm reduction info constituent drug perhaps using resource like drug users bible erowid adopt formal harm reduction process example following ‘ 10 commandments safer drug use ” https //drugusersbible.org/content/drugscape/safety\_first/the\_10\_commandments\_of\_safer\_drug\_use/index.html https //drugusersbible.org/content/drugscape/safety_first/the_10_commandments_of_safer_drug_use/index.html take close look tripsit combination chart heed contents see 10 commandments better tip n't take going take drug identify specific outcome actually want select specific drug deliver rather taking unknown combo vendors please really think twice sell stuff least honestly specify actual contents ratios people clearly getting serious trouble worse

Post-Overdose  Recovery,"I experienced an overdose about 2 weeks or so ago and I was wondering if anyone in this sub had some relatable advice to offer. 

I’ve been a heroin user on and off for about 13 years but I have been lucky. This was my first  serious od. I was standing up, my friend caught me and was able to hit me with a nasal dose, started rescue breaths. A couple we knew were outside the motel and she called them for help. When they entered the room I was blue and rattling, they moved me to the floor to start chest compressions and administered the naloxone they had (thank god). I remember waking up and falling back out a few times but not much else. A few hard slaps to the face finally brought me to consciousness and I popped up, wrapping my arms around the girls neck sobbing and thanking her. I don’t know why I came back so sad like that. I was out for about 15 minutes in total. 

I felt fine initially. Cried a lot for some reason and then slept for a long time. When I woke up the next morning I had a high fever, severe muscle stiffness/pain, confusion. Waited too long but went to the ER eventually and found out I had arteries riddled with MRSA and abscesses around the base of my skull. Luckily it wasn’t found in my spinal fluid.

Schizonauts: A bizarre approach to harm reduction,"My friend made an, in my opinion dope, animated series that feels like a point and click adventure playthrough, where he created a trippy and bizarre world that he uses to elaborate on responsible drug use, addiction, and the human psyche in a way I haven't seen anyone do this before.

He gave me permission to share this to some boards just to get some feedback so we're curious to hear your thoughts. We agree he needs to work a bit on the initial over exposition, but other than that, I think it's a decent series made by a singular person.

Really need help finding veins for IV use,"i've been IV'ing opioids for over 25 years (i'm 40 now), and i've been prescribed them since I started for severe chronic pain, but as soon as i discovered IV I realized how much i loved the rush, the nod, the warm hug euphoria, AND the pain relief. i've been using the same spot on my bicep for the past 5 years, using up to 5 or 6 hits daily, even reusing the same tip for 5 or more shots, and haven't had an issue until about a week and a half ago. that was when i i blew out the spot. i'm so upset. i've tried finding spots all over both arms and nothing works. i can't use my legs because i'm diabetic and leg stuff doesn't heal very well on me. i don't know what to do. it's at the point where i end up in tears after trying and trying to get my hit to register, and either getting no flash of blood, or getting a shitty flash of blood but then feeling it start to miss pretty much right away. then i end up with blood clots in the syringe barrel, and my shot ends up needing to be re filtered, a bunch gets wasted, and i'm losing my shit.

no i won't boof it, i don't care what anyone says it doesn't work as well for me. maybe cuz i'm always constipated, i don't know, and i don't care, a big part of why i do this is the rush from my opioids, i've been IV'ing for over 2 decades and obviously can't just use a method with less bioavailability, so that rules out everything other than IV and boofing, but again i won't boof it. please don't suggest it. i've tried it and ended up feeling sick and got nothing out of it. and since i'm prescribed it, i can't just ""use more and boof it"" because i don't HAVE more.

Do you think Harm Reduction is important? Then I need your help! The government is planning to completely cut funding for HR initiatives. We need your help to email politicians to change their mind. Here are instructions how...Easy way to help fight the war on drugs,"The non-profit [Mainline](https://mainline.nl/) shared [this message about possible plans of the current government to cut funding completely](https://mainline.nl/stop-de-wrede-bezuiniging-op-mainline/) of many harm reduction organizations. We can not let this happen because it will do us (the user) more harm than good. Let your voice be heard by sending the politicians an email. It does not matter if you're Dutch or not, this has international ramifications. Here's a template you can use and list of the politicians to send it to.

Dutch Instructions bellow:

#Stop the cruel cut on Mainline  

On 21 October, State Secretary Karremans announced a package of cuts. This also includes the complete phasing out of the subsidy that Mainline receives from the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. Out of nowhere. Without substantive argumentation. Where other institutions are cut by 4 to 15%, Mainline will be completely scrapped in three years' time. In the long run, this means the end of our organisation.

#Join us in the fight  

We call on all MPs, friends from the field and all people who care about us to help us. In a time of growing homelessness, increasing drug use in public spaces, the introduction of new, powerful substances – such as synthetic opiates (fentanyl, nitazenes) or strong stimulants such as flakka – Mainline is needed more than ever.

Knowledge about harm reduction, drugs, complex, combined problems: all of this can be lost. Our Mainline magazine – with which we reach almost all marginalized people who use drugs in the Netherlands with information – is disappearing. 34 years of passion, knowledge, skills. 34 years of work experience in more than 56 countries in the world. A final piece of activism and critical voice in the drug field. All gone. And worst of all: with Mainline, a piece of humanity also disappears. A warm gesture to people who survive at the very bottom of our society: gone.

#Mainline must not disappear  

Does this also make you very angry? Send an email to the MPs of the VWS committee. Call on them to stop this cold and cruel cut, which is not based on any substantive argument, during the budget debate on Thursday 24 October. Please share this post with everyone you know in the field. We cannot turn this political storm around on our own. All help is welcome!

#MAIL THE COMMITTEE OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, WELFARE AND SPORT  

Here is a sample email that you can send to all committee members of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport.

Dear members of the Parliamentary Committee on Health, Welfare and Sport,

I would like to urge you to reverse the proposed cuts to the Mainline Foundation. In a time of growing homelessness, increasing drug use in public spaces, the introduction of new, powerful substances – such as synthetic opiates (fentanyl, nitazenes) or strong stimulants such as flakka – Mainline is needed more than ever. If Mainline disappears, not only will a unique expertise on drugs, health, drug policy and harm reduction disappear, but also a final piece of humanity towards marginalized people who use drugs. I call on you to stop these cuts during the budget debate of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport on Thursday 24 October.

Sincerely,


[first name, last name]

Nederlandse instructies: 

#Stop de wrede bezuiniging op Mainline  

Op 21 oktober kondigde Staatssecretaris Karremans een pakket aan bezuinigingen aan. Daarbinnen valt ook de volledige afbouw van de subsidie die Mainline krijgt van het Ministerie van VWS. Uit het niets. Zonder inhoudelijke argumentatie. Waar andere instellingen gekort worden met 4 tot 15% wordt Mainline in drie jaar tijd volledig geschrapt. Op termijn betekent dat het einde van onze organisatie.


#Strijd met ons mee

Wij roepen alle Kamerleden, vrienden uit het werkveld en alle mensen die ons een warm hart toe dragen op om ons te helpen. In een tijd van groeiende dakloosheid, toenemend druggebruik in de openbare ruimte, de intrede van nieuwe, sterke middelen – zoals synthetische opiaten (fentanyl, nitazenen) of sterke stimulanten als flakka – is Mainline juist harder nodig dan ooit.

Kennis over harm reduction, drugs, complexe, gecombineerde problematiek: dit kan allemaal verloren gaan. Ons Mainline magazine – waarmee we vrijwel alle gemarginaliseerde mensen die drugs gebruiken in Nederland bereiken met voorlichting: verdwijnt. 34 jaar passie, kennis kunde. 34 jaar werkervaring in meer dan 56 landen in de wereld. Een laatste stukje activisme en kritisch geluid in het drugsveld. Allemaal weg. En het allerergst: met Mainline verdwijnt ook een stukje menselijkheid. Een warm gebaar naar mensen die helemaal aan de onderkant van onze maatschappij overleven: weg.

#Mainline mag niet verdwijnen

Word jij hier ook heel boos van? Stuur dan een mail naar de Kamerleden van de commissie van VWS. Roep hen op tijdens de begrotingsbehandeling van donderdag 24 oktober deze kille en wrede bezuiniging, die op geen enkel inhoudelijk argument is gebaseerd, te stoppen. Deel dit bericht met iedereen die je kent in het veld. Deze politieke storm kunnen wij niet in ons eentje kenteren. Alle hulp is welkom!

#MAIL DE COMMISSIE VAN VWS

Hierbij een voorbeeldmail die je kan sturen naar alle commissieleden van VWS.

Geachte leden van de Kamercommissie VWS,

Bij deze wil ik u dringend oproepen om de voorgenomen bezuiniging op stichting Mainline terug te draaien. In een tijd van groeiende dakloosheid, toenemend druggebruik in de openbare ruimte, de intrede van nieuwe, sterke middelen – zoals synthetische opiaten (fentanyl, nitazenen) of sterke stimulanten als flakka – is Mainline juist harder nodig dan ooit. Als Mainline verdwijnt, verdwijnt niet alleen een unieke expertise rond drugs, gezondheid, drugsbeleid en harm reduction, maar ook een laatste stuk menselijkheid richting gemarginaliseerde mensen die drugs gebruiken. Ik roep u op om tijdens de begrotingsbehandeling van VWS op donderdag 24 oktober deze bezuiniging tegen te houden.

Met vriendelijke groet,

[voornaam, achternaam]

New apartment ,"I just got an apartment by myself and it's strange to be by myself. I was trying to sober up but I found out I had covid yesterday and I kinda fucked up. At least it wasn't meth lol but still. I guess if I'm not going to have a completely clean act here, if I'm alone, when do I need to ask for help? I don't wanna die alone in my apartment. I was hanging out with friends and stuff to keep me busy but I found out I had covid and now have to tell so many people. I've never had my own place, before this I was homeless so I'd just sit outside on cameras or be inside awkwardly high asf (which was okay with them as long as you weren't a disturbance or like... Puking all over yourself... Not that that has happened to me before). But if I'm really alone and do end up fucked up, when do I need to ask for help?

worried about friend ,"hey y'all thought maybe someone here can help?
my friend is buying substances/pills online through sketchy retailers and won't stop even though me and our other friends have asked her to. she claims she checks them for fent but i KNOW her and she's likely only doing it occasionally. 
i've been carrying narcan with me just in case but is there more i can do? 
how do you tell if something from a random source is safe, can i get her a safer supply, is there a certain way to talk to her that'll convince her to listen to me and stop? idk just stressed so any help appreciated

Narcaned.... Again 😮‍💨🙄,"Honestly I'm just so sick of this. I want heroin back!!! 😭😭😭 I already OD'd on heroin twice but at least it was only twice! In my whole 5-year career of using it and both of those times it was really mixed with fentanyl back then. Now back fucking with this shit again and man. I'm just so sick of falling out. Every time I think maybe this is a little bit, Maybe this is good. There I am falling out again having to be narcaned again. Traumatizing my friends, making myself sick, and always having to have at least two things of narcan. 
And the worst part of it..... I don't even know how to make it register to myself how serious that is. How every single time I am possibly going to die and leave this world and I can't make myself care. I can't see it as serious. And when other people like my family try to tell me fentanyl is so dangerous. And act all serious about it. I just get more upset. Like hey we have narcan now like it'll be fine. Just don't use by yourself. But it is serious to have to be narcaned I guess. And the look on my boyfriend's face this last time was just heartbreaking. I woke up to him holding me, dancing with me, telling me he doesn't know what he's going to do when I am not here.  What am I going to do? Also why aren't they making each narcan spray 8mg instead of 4mg?!?!?  Most people only carry 1 narcan with them, especially non-druggies, and most people need 2 narcan to come out.

Things I'm learning or considering:

*including beer and nicotine on supply needs lists 

*including benadryl on those lists for alcohol and opioid withdrawal support

*many herbalists are offering natural medicines to communities. Utilizing herbalist support

Is the euphoria of 2cb very pronounced?  ,"I've heard 2 cb referred to as a very gentle psychedelic because it doesn't put you in a strange headspace.  I'm sure this is somewhat subjective, but that part of it does seem to be widely agreed upon.

There also seems to be a common feeling of euphoria, and some people liken it to MDMA.  I'm hoping this isn't actually a good comparison, and that the euphoria isn't too pronounced.  Not that I don't love feeling euphoric, but I have an unlucky brain chemistry that causes me to have very rough reactions to coming down from a state of euphoria.

For example, I've taken MDMA once in my adult life, and I don't know if I'll ever try it again.  It was tested, trusted, I dosed responsibly, etc.  When I was rolling of course I was having a beautiful time, but the minute I felt it start to slip away, I started panicking.  The feeling of the serotonin (or whatever) dropping feels like an existential rollercoaster, and it feels like a panic attack.   The comedown itself next day wasn't as bad as the night of the roll, but still, very rough experience coming off it.

Anyway, what I'm trying to find out is if 2cb is actually euphoric in a similar way to a drug like MDMA, or if it's described that way just because of the physical effects.  People often say LSD is euphoric, but I've never had that experience.  It can be amazing, beautiful, mindblowing, but ""euphoric"" is not a word I'd use for it.

In short, I'm hoping that the euphoria of 2cb is minimal for the aforementioned reasons.  What do you think?",2,5,2024-10-08 07:10:37,euphoria 2cb pronounced 've heard 2 cb referred gentle psychedelic n't put strange headspace 'm sure somewhat subjective part seem widely agreed upon also seems common feeling euphoria people liken mdma 'm hoping n't actually good comparison euphoria n't pronounced n't love feeling euphoric unlucky brain chemistry causes rough reactions coming state euphoria example 've taken mdma adult life n't know 'll ever try tested trusted dosed responsibly etc rolling course beautiful time minute felt start slip away started panicking feeling serotonin whatever dropping feels like existential rollercoaster feels like panic attack comedown next day n't bad night roll still rough experience coming anyway 'm trying find 2cb actually euphoric similar way drug like mdma 's described way physical effects people often say lsd euphoric 've never experience amazing beautiful mindblowing `` euphoric '' word 'd use short 'm hoping euphoria 2cb minimal aforementioned reasons think
Narcan use,,1,1,2024-10-07 23:32:16,narcan use
"Narcan, “duty to rescue”, & LEOs ","Okay, so I’ve had a question come up at work and I don’t know how to answer it. Wondering if someone can help.

One of the services my job provides is narcan trainings for non-profits/CBOs/city agencies etc. we’ve been trying to schedule a training for a certain department with the city who are not exactly police officers (I guess) but are technically LEOs. The person coordinating it just asked us to clarify if, as LEOs, if they have narcan and are trained, they have a duty to respond based on PA’s title 42 Good Samaritan Act.

I’m not a lawyer, but my argument would kind of encompass a few things: first of all, there isn’t really a duty to respond in the US - but if someone does respond to an emergency situation and then stops responding (like say you start giving CPR but then you just give up and walk away), they could be held liable for harms that then occur. My understanding is that this is because if you start helping, other people might walk by/not stop and help because they see there is assistance there.

Therefore, if someone who is clearly a LEO has arrived in response to an emergency situation, but then does not provide aid (I.e. narcan if someone is overdosing), could it be argued that they have prevented someone else from responding?

Additionally, the Good Samaritan Act says “any person… who in good faith renders emergency care…shall not be liable for any civil damages as a result of rendering such care, except in any act or omission intentionally designed to harm or any grossly negligent acts or omissions which result in harm.” By coming on the scene are LEOs assumed to be rendering care? In that care would a failure to administer narcan be potentially considered a “grossly negligent act or omission”?

I want to reiterate that I am not a lawyer and I probably don’t know what I’m talking about, and that all of this probably depends on case law which I don’t think I have access to? But hoping someone here can give me their opinion/perspective/feedback/suggestions for what to say to this person?",7,10,2024-10-04 15:44:29,narcan “ duty rescue ” leos okay ’ question come work ’ know answer wondering someone help one services job provides narcan trainings non-profits/cbos/city agencies etc ’ trying schedule training certain department city exactly police officers guess technically leos person coordinating asked us clarify leos narcan trained duty respond based pa ’ title 42 good samaritan act ’ lawyer argument would kind encompass things first ’ really duty respond us someone respond emergency situation stops responding like say start giving cpr give walk away could held liable harms occur understanding start helping people might walk by/not stop help see assistance therefore someone clearly leo arrived response emergency situation provide aid i.e narcan someone overdosing could argued prevented someone else responding additionally good samaritan act says “ person… good faith renders emergency care…shall liable civil damages result rendering care except act omission intentionally designed harm grossly negligent acts omissions result harm. ” coming scene leos assumed rendering care care would failure administer narcan potentially considered “ grossly negligent act omission ” want reiterate lawyer probably ’ know ’ talking probably depends case law ’ think access hoping someone give opinion/perspective/feedback/suggestions say person

Any advice on how to not do this in the future, after spending so much time avoiding it and keeping my shit together, but without a word spoke or a dollar spent it was in my hand…I have no intention on getting more but I just wish I had been strong enough to just throw it away, I’ve been presented situations like this with dope, but being on Suboxone, has truly worked there, and I haven’t had a craving for coke in nearly 2 years.

Scared this morphine pill may be fake.,"Im not experienced much with pain pills. But im super depressed and have this crushed morphine I been saving for a few years. I wanna get high but the only thing holding me back is obviously being worried it could be fake.  Before it was crushed it was round and white.

Cocaine while on SSRIs,"Hello,

I tried cocaine for the first time on SSRIs (Fluoxetine), and expected it to be quite nice.

However, when I had snorted it and waited 20 minutes for it to kick in, I still felt nothing. This resulted in me trying two more times, and consuming about 60mg total, after which I called it quits and went to bed.

This has happened with serveral other substances, such as MDMA, LSD and Tramadol.

Website of The European Network of Drug Consumption Rooms is finally online,,7,1,2024-09-25 07:39:16,website european network drug consumption rooms finally online
"Description, comparison and rating of 14 opioids ","All opioids listed-Kratom, Tramadol, O-DSMT, Tilidin, Tapentadol , 2-me-AP-237, Poppy seed tea, Poppy pod tea, Opium, Morphine, Heroin, Oxycodone, Hydromorphone, Buprenorphine

I will not go into too much detail as I don't want the post to be overly long, but if there's anything you wonder about, feel free to ask and ill answer as best as I can.

###1-Kratom (4/10)
- Kratom is a weak partial opioid agonist, it also has other mechanisms of action, most notably NMDA antagonism. 
- Using loose powders results in quicker onset of action, and using capsules results in slower onset of action, but avoiding the highly off-putting taste. 
- Taking antacid ahead of taking Kratom can potentiate it's effects.
- It's used orally.
- Depending on the kind of Kratom used, the effects can be more stimulating or more sedating.
- Kratom isn't recreational, but is good for work, for pain and for reducing withdrawals from other stronger opioids.
- At high doses Kratom not only creates typical opioid effects, but also some mild dissociation

 ###2-Tramadol (2.5/10)
- Tramadol is a weak synthetic opioid, 100mg is equal to 10mg morphine. It also possesses SNDRI activity, which at low doses results in antidepressant effects, in high doses it can cause unpleasant side effects, and at overly high doses it can cause serotonin syndrome and seizures. I personally wouldn't go over 200mg, as at those doses I start feeling like I am coming up on MDMA and get panic attacks, and above 100mg I get unpleasant side effects such as anxiety.
- It's used orally.
- Apart from that it creates typical opioid effects, it's slightly more stimulating than other opioids and it's not very recreational for most ppl.
- Most of it's opioid effects come from it's metabolite O-DSMT. Which can be a problem for poor metabolisers. 
- It must not be combined with many medications, too many to list.

 ###3-O-DSMT (4/10)
- O-DSMT is a metabolite of tramadol, which is somewhat more potent. It's mainly an opioid agonist, one of it's enantiomers has some NRI activity, but weak. It is also 5-HT2C antagonist, which may result in some antidepressants effects (it's part of agomelatines antidepressant activity)
It's not very recreational, but it's effective at making one numb, sedated and without a care. 
- It feels rather robotic and unnatural, which makes it less recreational, but no less functional and helpful in tough situations.
- It's used orally (rectally works too, and my gf says it's more recreational,I haven't tried it yet)
- It allows for higher doses than tramadol, but overly high doses can cause headaches and nausea.   

###4-Tilidin (6/10)
- Tilidin is another synthetic opioid, 100mg is equivalent of 10mg morphine (some sources say 20mg instead, but 10mg seems more accurate from my experience). It also possesses NMDA antagonistic properties and DRI activity, giving it slight stimulating and minimal dissociating properties. 
- It's used orally, especially since its often mixed with naloxone.
- Unlike tramadol and O-DSMT, as well as some other, it feels rather natural and doesn't have es much robotic and artificial feelings to it.
- With low enough tolerance, Tilidin can be recreational, but overall it's mainly functional. 
- It doesn't have any significant side effects unless overly high doses are used, and even then the side effects are mild in comparison to other synthetics.
- It feels most akin to very low dose of oxy imo, with a bit more synthesic feel to it.

###5-Tapentadol (6/10)
- Tapentadol a synthetic opioid, 100mg is equivalent to 30mg morphine. It is also a relatively strong NRI, which results in some unique effects, side effects and interactions. 
- It's used orally, snorting is reported to be very painful, my gf reports that it works rectally too, but I don't see the point in using it that way.
- Tapentadol has more potential for recreational use than previously mentioned opioids, but less than morphine and such. It's overall neither sedating nor stimulating, and the NRI activity can cause anxiety, dizziness, muscle spasms but usually not insomnia, on the other hand, it improves concentration and helps with wakefulness and at times even productivity.   
- It's opioid effects feel synthetic and somewhat robotic, although less so than O-DSMT. It's not a good anxiolytic, but it's pretty effective against pain.
- Careful about interactions, combining it with caffeine and nicotine increases their stimulating and anxiogenic effects significantly, combination with some drugs can be dangerous.

###6-2-me-AP-237 (4/10)
- 2-me-AP-237 is a research chemical synthetic opioid, it's exactly potency is unknown, but relatively potent. It's most likely only opioid agonist.
- It has less recreational potential than morphine but more than tapentadol or Tilidin. It's not very functional.
- It feels unnatural and is very sedating, it creates appreciable amount of euphoria and anxiolisis. It feels a bit weird and unhealthy imo. 
- Its reported to be very caustic, and damaging to organs, so I highly recommend using it only orally and strictly avoiding habitual use.

###7-Poppy seed tea (0/10)
- Poppy seeds should contain active alkaloids such as morphine, but from my experience, the tea caused nothing more than slight sedation, nausea, and feeling like I shouldn't put more of that into my body.

###8-Poppy pod tea (N/A)
- Poppy pod tea is made by soaking crushed up poppy pods in 80C water with a bit of lemon juice for at least 2h, and them drinking it.
- The resulting tea should contain alkaloids such as morphine and codeine. 
- But unfortunately the effects of this tea are extremely unpredictable, ranging from incredibly strong and euphoric experience, akin to high dose of opium, to inactive or even sickness inducing tea.
- I recommend being very careful if you decide to try this, as it can easily result in overdose if you happen to get highly potent poppy pods, like I did the first time (I was one or two poppy pods away from overdose). So start small and slow. 

###9-Opium (9,5/10)
- Opium is a natural substance, produced by scoring (cutting the surface of) poppy pods, letting the milky substance flow out, waiting till it dries a little (1h or so), and then collecting it and further drying it. Scoring has to be done carefully, the inner wall of the pod shouldn't be pierced, that could lead to dying out and rotting of the pod. Only one, or few at most, cuts are done per day, and this process is repeated daily, in order to maximalize the yield.
- Opium consists of mainly morphine, but also other alkaloids, which attune the felt effects. The exact contents change based on the location of the farm.
- Opium can be smoked, which is rather difficult, imo it's better to dissolve it into a tea (like chamomile), and drink it. Starting with 100mg.
- The effects feel very natural, sedating, anxiolytic and very euphoric. It can be both recreational and functional, and is even suitable for socializing. It's very effective against pain and mental suffering. 
- It's one of my favorites, unfortunately it tends to be very expensive.

###10-Morphine (9/10)
- Morphine is a natural opioid, it is used as a standart for equianalgesic calculations/conversions and is the first and most widespread opioid used. Many other opioids are derived from it.
- Its most commonly used orally, IV or IM. It can me snorted and used rectally also. It's the only opioid I ever injected. 
- Similar to opium, it is very recreational but also functional, very sedating, anxiolytic, very helpful against pain, natural feelings (although less so than opium) and overall very enjoyable.
- But like opium and heroin, it causes a lot of histamine release and thus itchiness, to remedy that I recommend taking second generation antihistamines such as citerizin. 
- Injecting creates powerful, euphoric and almost stunning rush. The closest thing to it would be smoking heroin, which produces considerably milder rush, but enough to give you an idea how it feels. I advice against injecting if you haven't started yet, it's not worth it.

###11-Heroin (10/10 if uncut and good quality)
- Heroin is semisynthetic opioid, it's made by acetylation of morphine, which increases bioavailability, speeds up absorbtion, makes it more suitable for smoking and increases it's potency. 
- It's method of action is more or less the same as that of morphine, as it mostly acts as a pro-drug.
- Its most commonly administered through IV, smoked or snorted. IM is advices again due to it causing tissue damage, and oral transforms it back to morphine before getting absorbed.
- I personally always smoke it, as it's less harmful than IV while still retaining some rush, and the ritual of smoking it is nice. This is done with a piece of foil, tube for inhaling and a lighter.
- Its effects are mostly similar to morphine, but its onset is faster, duration of peak effects shorter (although that depends on the ROA), and it tends to cause more cravings.
- Its also overall feels a bit dirtier than morphine, in a good way.
- Its the most euphoric and addictive opioid, it creates an unique headspace which, as long as your tolerance isn't overly high, feels even magical. Same can be said about opium and to lesser extent morphine.
- Theres large amount of various cuts that can be in there, Iam talking about pure, uncut heroin, I highly advise against the usage of cut heroin.

###12-Oxycodone (8/10)
- Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid derived from morphine, orally it's 1,5 times more potent than oral morphine. It's only an opioid agonist.
- The overall effects and safety is very similar to morphine, with only few differences. 
- The main difference is that it feels considerably more stimulating than morphine, which isn't caused by any effects on monamines. The headspace is similar, but more uplifting and productive. It's about as euphoric as morphine.

###13-Hydromorphone (7/10)
- Hydromorphone is another semisynthetic opioid. It's 3-3.75 times more potent than morphine (orally) and 10 times more potent than morphine when injected. Its only an opioid agonist.
- I personally don't like it as much as morphine or oxy, because even though it's very strong, it's not as euphoric and it's prone to causing delusion of sobriety, which resulted in me using excessively high doses. I am unsure if this happens to other people too, but it's something to be aware of. This excessively high dosing also triggered unexpected withdrawals for me. I haven't gotten delusion of sobriety from any other opioid so far.
- Overall it's a good opioid, but it feels less natural than morphine, more dreamy and makes you more put of it, and has tendency to cause delusion of sobriety and compulsive redosing.

###14-Buprenorphine (1/10)
- Buprenorphine is semisynthetic opioid, it works as  mixed agonist/antagonist, but most importantly, it is a very high affinity partial agonist at mu opioid receptors. That means that it can active those receptors only to a given extent, creating a ceiling to the effects. 
- The extremely high affinity displaces other opioids, and doesn't allow them to bind till the Buprenorphine is removed.
- Both of these factors can result in precipitation withdrawals when buprenorphine is taken too soon, displacing the stronger opioid, results in lower mu opioid activation, resulting in withdrawals.
- Buprenorphine is very potent, sublingually it's 40 times more potent than morphine. Orally it's almost inactive.
- Its has very long duration, main effects last about 24 hours, with residual effects lasting up to 48 ours on top. That's when used sublingually, it can also be injected and used as an plaster, but it's not active orally.
- When used sublingually, hold the table under the tongue for 20min and then spit out the rest, do not swallow.
- Its main use is for opioid addiction, it can be also used for other addictions and chronic pain, but from my experience, it's rather ineffective for pain, especially considering the amount of side effects at required doses. 
- From my experience, higher doses are more effective for pain, but some people say lower doses are more effective. 
- Its feels unnatural and lackluster, it's somewhat sedating and anxiolytic, it doesn't feel intoxicating after initial few days, and it made me rather depressed after a while.
- The reason I rate it so low are the side effects. Keep in mind that those side effects might not occur for everyone. I experienced depression, headaches, extreme constipation (main reason I discontinued it, I was at the point of thinking of going to the hospital, I couldn't even eat anymore), and complete lack of appetite and happiness received from any activities.
- Its you ever get to the point of having to use this medication, give it a try, but don't force it if it doesn't work well for you.

What is the deal with the one for one syringe exchanges,"This one has literally been keeping me up for the past few days.

I do understand the part where some organisations opt for one for one exchange if they would not have enough to give around, but I fail to understand why do some states mandate it? 

What are they trying to achieve, if anything the discarded syringes are more likely to actually be infectious since they will probably be reused/shared if given out as a part of one for one exchanges.

And last but not least, how seriously are one for one requirements taken, especially in the states that require it, is the amount generally only (generously) estimated or are the syringes brought back counted one by one?

Thank you.",18,45,2024-09-23 07:32:27,deal one one syringe exchanges one literally keeping past days understand part organisations opt one one exchange would enough give around fail understand states mandate trying achieve anything discarded syringes likely actually infectious since probably reused/shared given part one one exchanges last least seriously one one requirements taken especially states require amount generally generously estimated syringes brought back counted one one thank
State-funded HRO programs,"I live in a state in the US where harm reduction efforts are funded (and controlled) by the state’s department of health. 

On one hand, the DOH gives HR programs free money for operations, controls the supplies and therefore makes most smoking and injection supplies legal to carry under the HR laws, and all reporting is thru them. 

On the other hand, there are always weird political and bureaucratic hoops to jump through that I imagine can further marginalize the grassroots efforts in the state (though in my experience folks including myself will generally work in both spheres and there seems to be a symbiotic relationship). And like I said, weird political things which means for example that we can legally give out all smoking supplies except for glass. 

Do folks in states without DOH mandating of HRO operations wish it would function that way for ease? Are you extremely opposed to that outcome/possibility? Is there a reason that it’s not a more widespread model? I know not everything is black and white, but are there ways that it’s worse for the DOH to be in charge?

Is it safer to smoke crack or inject cocaine? - non user asking for clarity on harm reduction policy at work,"Hi all, housing support worker here. 

I work in a supportive housing program where residents are not allowed to smoke inside. But there is supposedly a harm reduction policy where residents can use in their rooms. It is very vague and turns drugs into this giant elephant in the room. 

Obviously, people are smoking crack inside. The housing program is literally right next door to the probation office (I'm not fucking kidding) so their is just no way people are going to feel safe smoking crack outside. And there is no elevator so folks on the top floors would have to go up and down like every time which is just not a realistic expectation. ALSO because we are not a safe use site, I don't think we would even be able to condone people using illegal substances outside. The whole reason it is allowed in their rooms is because we can have plausible deniability in the eyes of the law. 

I'm currently writing an email to management about the holes and paradoxes in our policy. One point I was planning on making was that we are allowing people to use intravenously but punishing people for smoking. I just assumed that smoking crack was safer than injecting cocaine. (Side note, Can you inject crack? Again, I  assumed you can't since it's a solid rock and not a powder. Please tell me if I'm wrong. I really want to know as much as possible so I can be helpful to the residents.) 

But I had a co-worker from a different program tell me a few weeks back that it was not safer to smoke crack compared to injecting cocaine. They never explained why (they were catching a bus). Is this true? If yes why?

Question about medications and psilocybin for harm reduction purposes. ,"I have a friend who wants to take psilocybin mushrooms. She’s on a variety of medications and I told her it’s not a good idea unless she stops taking certain ones for an (unknown) period of time first. 

The problem is I don’t understand how her medication acts in her body to advise her which ones she should stop taking nor for how long she should stop taking them for before using the mushrooms. 

I was hoping if I provided a list of her medications (unsure if dosage matters so I will include the ones I know) someone might be able to tell me which ones she should avoid taking before ingesting the mushrooms and for how long she should stop taking them beforehand?

NPR Reports 10% Dip in US Overdose Deaths,"[NPR reports](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/nx-s1-5107417/overdose-fatal-fentanyl-death-opioid) that overdose rates have dipped about 10%. The news makes me cautiously hopeful. But, fuck, it's been an absolute clusterfuck for as long as I can remember. 

Some of the more establishment-type voices are saying it's because of OTC naloxone and the x-waiver for bupe getting dropped. It's probably not.

alcohol harm reduction / is it realistic for me ?,"heyo

gonna say what i'm currently thinking about in terms of goals and other things. feel free to give me a reality check and any other input

i don't think i wanna cut alcohol entirely. mixology sounds so so fun, my in-laws have like a patrilineal schnapps-making tradition (as in each has their own recipes), and other things i wanna try not for fear of missing out but because of genuine curiosity

main thing i think i need is to see alcohol as occasional and not have it so _often_
part of why it's harder to think i have a problem is because when i drink by myself i don't do so with the intention of getting drunk and never have gotten drunk alone, just a little buzz which makes many things easier from cleaning to social interaction to any task i am scared of 

drinking in social situations is a different kettle of fish. it's hard to listen to myself when 1) other people are drinking faster/more often (and often straight from the bottle vs. in, say, a shot glass) 2) stimuli from social interaction and ambience mean i concentrate on both

it's not peer pressure.. which a lot of people would assume. i developed a 'positive' relationship with alcohol independently when i found that drinking (again, very little at a time) made being in my body a bit easier, thanks to what i not much later learned was gender dysphoria - genuinely i was uncomfortable at how my chest moved and was literally always tense, found walking uncomfortable, etc. and after a drink i could lie down and relax for what felt like the first time.
and even when ways to mitigate it became accessible to me (binding and socially transitioning at university has helped immensely) that relationship unfortunately remained, especially when light stress of social interaction and heavy stress of work crept in.

i have worked out some harm reduction (?) strategies (or just things that make drinking genuinely enjoyable as intended rather than going wrong) - such as pouring drinks out, mixing them, also just forcing myself to stop for a bit despite the pace of those around me and assessing how i feel then. but i find them hard to follow/optimise - how much to pour out at once, how to do so without feeling out of place, how long to stop for, etc. least i can do is some research which i need to do and hold myself accountable using it without falling into the trap of thinking it'll be fine if i don't one time or two

also i think picking a social event to not drink at
and actually saying that out loud (and of course sticking to it - which i could definitely do if i did the first step) would help immensely. again, i need to get myself to actually do that

probably also worth mentioning i have epilepsy and while drinking occasionally/being mindful is fine, drinking a lot isn't and while i (thankfully!) haven't had drink-related seizures during social interactions, i have sometimes woke up hungover and seized then
probably also worth mentioning all definite seizures i've had caused by alcohol (and also all seizures except 2(3?)) i've been aware during and they've not been that hard on my body

i wish it were easier. it's not like i have much of a problem 'cutting down' on food but i do still eat at least once a day 

but also if you think me pacing / doing harm reduction is not actually that realistic and i should stop altogether, at least for a fixed, substantial period of time, feel free to say so.

that was a lot of info. if (hopefully when) i find it in me (and find the funds) to go to therapy maybe i'll show them this - maybe i'll tweak it to be accurate to that present time. whatever the case, i vow to be honest. in the meantime, thank you for reading!",9,9,2024-09-07 15:25:27,alcohol harm reduction realistic heyo gon na say 'm currently thinking terms goals things feel free give reality check input n't think wan na cut alcohol entirely mixology sounds fun in-laws like patrilineal schnapps-making tradition recipes things wan na try fear missing genuine curiosity main thing think need see alcohol occasional _often_ part 's harder think problem drink n't intention getting drunk never gotten drunk alone little buzz makes many things easier cleaning social interaction task scared drinking social situations different kettle fish 's hard listen 1 people drinking faster/more often often straight bottle vs. say shot glass 2 stimuli social interaction ambience mean concentrate 's peer pressure .. lot people would assume developed 'positive relationship alcohol independently found drinking little time made body bit easier thanks much later learned gender dysphoria genuinely uncomfortable chest moved literally always tense found walking uncomfortable etc drink could lie relax felt like first time even ways mitigate became accessible binding socially transitioning university helped immensely relationship unfortunately remained especially light stress social interaction heavy stress work crept worked harm reduction strategies things make drinking genuinely enjoyable intended rather going wrong pouring drinks mixing also forcing stop bit despite pace around assessing feel find hard follow/optimise much pour without feeling place long stop etc least research need hold accountable using without falling trap thinking 'll fine n't one time two also think picking social event drink actually saying loud course sticking could definitely first step would help immensely need get actually probably also worth mentioning epilepsy drinking occasionally/being mindful fine drinking lot n't thankfully n't drink-related seizures social interactions sometimes woke hungover seized probably also worth mentioning definite seizures 've caused alcohol also seizures except 2 3 've aware 've hard body wish easier 's like much problem 'cutting food still eat least day also think pacing harm reduction actually realistic stop altogether least fixed substantial period time feel free say lot info hopefully find find funds go therapy maybe 'll show maybe 'll tweak accurate present time whatever case vow honest meantime thank reading
People are starting to notice I’m not eating,"I relapsed fairly recently on a couple stimulant drugs and since then I’ve barely eaten. My family doesn’t necessarily eat dinner sitting together but we’ve started eating it at the same time so they’ve noticed when I only spend a couple minutes out of my room “eating” (sitting in front of my food just staring at it). I’ve tried sitting longer to make it seem like I’m actually eating something but I’m too antsy to sit still for more than just a couple minutes before leaving. I’ve gone from 97 pounds to 88 in less than a month.

I haven’t been 88 pounds in probably about 10 years and even then that was when I was a growing kid and it was normal for me to be that size. I’ve never really been skinny—at least in my eyes—and over the years have actually lost 27 pounds which has been mostly to do with stimulant use anyway.

The problem is that I have BDD and even I’ve started to be able to see my weight loss which means I know that if anyone is paying attention they can see it too. I also know for a fact that my mom has noticed my eating because she’s commented on it multiple times and even accused me of starving myself and puking up my food. Most recently she asked me if I had been eating or sleeping and I was honest because I knew if she was asking she already knew and now she’s under the impression that I’m having a manic episode (I have diagnosed BP1) which to be fair I think I am too.

For the time being it seems I get a pass but me and her both know that episodes don’t last forever and at some point I’m gonna have to do something about this. So far I’ve been trying to force myself to eat at least a couple bites of food every day so that I don’t feel so faint all the time but whenever I do that I feel incredibly sick. On top of that I work with food and just being around it makes me sick to my stomach.

I’m really not sure what to do right now. The only time I can really lie about having eaten is when I go to work because at home everyone is usually in the living room which is by the kitchen. Does anyone have any tips on how I can fix this? Preferably ones that don’t involve force feeding myself 😅",7,19,2024-09-07 16:20:16,people starting notice ’ eating relapsed fairly recently couple stimulant drugs since ’ barely eaten family ’ necessarily eat dinner sitting together ’ started eating time ’ noticed spend couple minutes room “ eating ” sitting front food staring ’ tried sitting longer make seem like ’ actually eating something ’ antsy sit still couple minutes leaving ’ gone 97 pounds 88 less month ’ 88 pounds probably 10 years even growing kid normal size ’ never really skinny—at least eyes—and years actually lost 27 pounds mostly stimulant use anyway problem bdd even ’ started able see weight loss means know anyone paying attention see also know fact mom noticed eating ’ commented multiple times even accused starving puking food recently asked eating sleeping honest knew asking already knew ’ impression ’ manic episode diagnosed bp1 fair think time seems get pass know episodes ’ last forever point ’ gon na something far ’ trying force eat least couple bites food every day ’ feel faint time whenever feel incredibly sick top work food around makes sick stomach ’ really sure right time really lie eaten go work home everyone usually living room kitchen anyone tips fix preferably ones ’ involve force feeding 😅

In Praise of Smoke Works,"So perhaps this is neither here nor there, but I just wanted to pop in here and share my experiences working with a harm redux group out of Boston called Smoke Works. 

Now, by working with them, I don’t mean actually working with them in the traditional sense, but in the interactions I’ve had with the group I’ve been left highly impressed with their work, their mission, the outstanding character of the people running the organization that I’ve had the pleasure to meet. 

So to bring you up to speed, since I know a good few of us here work in harm reduction and so I’ll say just in brief what their mission is- and hey, it’s likely you’re familiar with them already. Smoke works is a group that focuses on harm reduction by means of injection alternatives. They found early on that the smoker seemed to be somewhat left out or underserved in a traditional exchange program- and that’s largely true, anyone who’s been to these places know the overwhelming majority of attention goes to iv users. 

So in not only addressing the needs of smokers and thereby getting them into a place where you can connect them to a myriad of other services, they’ve found that many iv users wouldn’t use that way if they had a reasonable alternative- like a pipe for a heroin user- which is something they offer now. Heroin hammers are pretty excellent and a great alternative for a lot of users and their particular use case scenarios. 

As they have grown and expanded, now much of the work they do at smoke works is in helping to get small, independents, grass roots harm reduction groups off the ground by means of funding, education, mentoring/guidance, and even material support- that is, if your start up group can’t afford to buy all those things you need to make kits to pass out, you can register with smoke works and potentially get those supplies at a deep discount, if not free. 

If you are familiar with them, go check out smokeworks.org. I can’t speak any more highly of them 

Thanks.

Safest way to consume alcohol and cocaine,"I understand this is a dangerous combo. Coca ethylene could lead to fatal results. Recently I had 4 beers and 4 lines and was feeling very euphoric. Maybe a little too euphoric.. There was 3 or 4 times where I had to close my eyes and just feel the euphoric rush for 15 20 seconds. It felt great but, is this a sign of a near overdose? 

Is there a more safe way to do these two at the same time? Alcohol first then white? Wait x amount of time after drinking to chop lines?

Psychosis?,"Went by one of my plugs tonight. He was alone, but seemed to have a conversation going with a person that wasn't there. He didn't talk but looked at a point in the room and nodded and made gestures. I made a joke, but he sort of indicated that he couldn't talk. I got a bit worried and asked him he had done any pills,  and also that he was talking to someone that wasn't there. He then answered and said that he talks a lot to himself (that's not what was going on I think).  
He does loads of speed, mostly dropping street speed I think.  Is that it, speed psychosic? I got the feeling that it was some deliriant but he looked normal, and didn't seem to be dry mouthed and he doesn't like psychedelics in any form.

Should I talk to my friend about harm reduction for cocaine usage?,"I don’t really post on Reddit much, so apologies if this comes across as scatter brained and unorganized.

I have been close friends with someone, let’s call her Aurora, for about 3 years now. Aurora has always been a heavy marijuana user, which is something I’ve never had any qualms with. IMO, if you’re gonna choose a drug to use on the regular to help enjoy your life more, I feel that pot is one of the better options.

Anyways. Aurora has a friend that she’s known for a long time who has recently re-emerged into her life. Just some back story about this friend, he is an ex heroin addict (or current, if you go by the “once an addict, always an addict” rules) that has been clean for several years now. This friend is also a dealer, and he mostly sells several drugs. Dude is a little off, but what former addict/dealer isn’t? Important note, he tests all the product he sells to ensure safety, is fairly educated on the effects of all the drugs he sells and partake in, does not pressure people to take drugs, (as far as I can tell) and I have consumed shrooms from him before.

Here’s where we get into the concern. Let’s call the dealer Apple. Apple has been supplying free, small amounts (I’m talking bumps) of pure cocaine to Aurora whenever they hang out. This has been going on for a couple months now. At first I didn’t take it seriously, but Aurora is hanging out with Apple regularly now. Sometimes 1-2 times a week, and from what I’ve seen, she is consuming at least a couple to several bumps (not full on lines) of coke during each of these hang outs, to the best of my knowledge.

When she first did it, I laughed with her about it, assuming it was the typical twenty-something experience of trying a harder drug once to get an idea of what it’s like. But as I stated, it’s been more and more frequent. I should also note, that she has joked several times and stated that “it isn’t really all it’s cracked up to be,” “it’s not really that fun,” and that she doesn’t “understand how people could even get addicted to it.” I digress.

I recently had a conversation with Aurora about this, explaining to her that as her friend, I am concerned about her recently frequent cocaine usage, and encouraged her to be mindful of her usage as it is a hard drug that is highly addictive.

She laughed it off and stated I should be more worried about her marijuana usage, and that she only does the coke socially, therefore it’s not a big deal. To which I responded with a bit of tough love, explaining that doing coke at least once a week, or 52 times a year for perspective, is a bit past social usage and is concerning, and if the usage increases, I will be distancing myself from her.

My main concerns are that because this friend/dealer is supplying Aurora for free, I am worried that Apple may get her hooked, so that she will have to start purchasing from him. Maybe that’s a bit harsh to assume, but I don’t know the guy crazy well. I know for a fact if she starts using it more regularly, I will have to distance myself from her because I don’t feel comfortable associating with a frequent hard drug user. (For context, my partner also has family members that have gone through a coke to meth to heroin pipeline, which is scary to think about, and also means that my partner is also concerned and already distancing themself from my friend, which makes me sad to see.) Aurora herself has also stated several times that she has an addictive personality, and I feel as her friend that I have a certain level of responsibility to monitor that and check her when I see her partaking in something unhealthy because I care about her.

I would hate to loose a friend over drug usage, especially if it continues to progress and become unhealthy. I don’t really know if this post is to vent, or ask for advice. Maybe some of you could provide some perspective on how you would feel in this situation or what you would do in my shoes. I am not sure what to do from here, but I know I won’t watch a friend go down a bad path if it starts to look like she may.

Antidepressants and MDMA,"Im hoping I’ve come to the right subreddit for this. I was on 10 mg of Paxil for years and it never seemed to inhibit the effects of MDMA. The dosage was low enough and I’d done it enough times that I wasn’t worried about serotonin syndrome. However, recently I completely withdrew from Paxil and switched to a Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA) as opposed to an SSRI. I’m on 25 mg of clomipramine. I’m worried about how this new drug could interact with MDMA. To reduce the risk of serotonin syndrome or other issues, I’m wondering how many days/hours prior to rolling I should start skipping my antidepressants.
I’ve accidentally gone several days at a time without my antidepressants and I know that withdrawal symptoms aren’t that bad for me / are hardly noticeable after just a few days, so I’m not as worried about the psychological effects of skipping my antidepressants for a few days as I am the physical dangers of mixing them with Molly. 
It’s really hard to find any information on this especially because TCAs are not nearly as ubiquitous as SSRIs.

Ambien (and Z drugs on the whole).,"I was wondering if any of you have experience in dealing with problems resulting from the use/misuse of Zolpidem or Zopiclone?
Everybody seems to be aware that they're not quite the non-addictive harmless alternative to benzodiazepines that Merck claimed when introducing them. 
Way back in the late 90s, I experienced a Z drug blackout myself and wound up getting my nose broken as a result of my behaviour during that episode- had they not recorded me, to this day there's just no way I could understand how or why I could have even been capable of such activities -but record me they did so as hard as it is to conceive, it's undeniable.
Ever since, I've watched this phenomenon repeatedly mocked, derided and denied - tbh, had I not experienced it first hand, I'd be equally skeptical. I was by no means a heavy or frequent user and subsequently spoke to countless people who had very similar stories to relate.  
Between then and now, I followed the story closely. It's one of those situations (you'll know what I mean) where you can see the car stalled on the level crossing and the train fast approaching- knowing full well the inevitable and horrifying conclusion.

"Will there ever be safe supply or dependancy medication (like methadone, suboxone, antebuse) for crack-cocaine?","Front line housing worker here.

The housing program I currently work in has a lot of crack cocaine use. I'll be real, compared to my last job, it's basically causing no problems other than relapses being contagious. The people who came into the program smoking crack-cocaine are literally vibing and maintaining their housing like bosses. Versus the people who came in sober from it are unfortunately relapsing like dominos.

At my previous job, which was very high acuity and harm reduction oriented, most people were on Suboxone for opioid addiction. A lucky few were in a pilot safe supply program for opiates. It was life changing. People who had to spend all day hustling, stealing, panning, selling, etc to get substance could start to focus on themselves. They literally just went to the pharmacy everyday and they gave them the exact amount of safe supply that they told the doctor they use each day. It was amazing. Except that most of the people were also addicted to crack. So even though they now didn't have to worry about how they were going to get opiates, they still had to figure out how they were going to get crack. 

During the pandemic, at my old job, the government prescribed all the residents safe supply to prevent them from going out to get substances and potentially spread the virus. I didn't work there then. It sounded hectic but great. The problem is, there is no legal equivalent that pharmacists can prescribe for crack cocaine, so instead they prescribed adderall. I've never done either substance, but from what people have told me, that is not a sufficient equivalent. 

So since I worked at my last job, I have thought that there really needs to be some sort of Suboxone or methadone equivalent for crack cocaine. To reduce the cravings. Also there should be safe-supply of sorts that isn't ADHD meds. I haven't done opiates or crack and I know that the opiate dependancy meds are primarily to prevent withdrawal. So I don't know if that is also an issue with crack. But it's incredibly addictive and I heard it releases three times the amount of dopamine compared to other substances so obviously the cravings are probably insane. So if there was something to help with the cravings, maybe like antabuse (alcohol addiction), then that would obviously help relieve a lot of suffering. 

I have tried googling this to figure out if anything is in the works and I can't find anything. I cannot believe, that given how intense and prevalent crack cocaine addiction is, that this is not something being investigated or researched. From my experience, the two substances that people were most addicted to were opiates and crack. By only having safe supply and dependancy drugs for opiates, we are only addressing half the problem. 

There's been a lot of issues at my current job involving crack since my current job is much higher barrier than my last so has harder rules on use. I'm frustrated because I feel at a loss on how to help people when the treatment of addiction to crack cocaine is so black and white. 

Does anyone know if crack cocaine dependancy medication is in the works? Or if there are any crack cocaine safe supply programs out there? I just really want to believe that there is.

HHC‼️,"i felt like this was important to share. I (F20) i have been vaping HHC vapes since early april 2024. like everyone else i thought they were great and made me feel more socialable and anxious (this will be ironic later 💀) Keep in mimd i was never a heavy smoker and had only smoke weed 3-5 times before, and half of those experiences i greened out. Anyway two weekends ago i was expierencing really bad anxiety, to cut a very long story short i had the WORST panic attack of my life. i came in and out of consciousness, i truly felt like i was dying. in the past ive had to stay in hospital for over a month and get mutiple surgeries…. this panic attack was still worse than that. for the next week i was feeling severe anxiety everyday to the point someone had to be with me 24/7. my life became unbearable i couldnt leave the house, get dressed, wash myself and even developed bed soars. In no way has this made me anti weed, if anything it has made me want to push for the legalisation and BAN on HHC products. After seeing a psychologist he explained that everyday more and more people are being affected by these vapes leading them into psychosis,panic disorder, hallucinations and more. Please if your reading this STOP SMOKING AND BUYING HHC PRODUCTS. they arent safe and will soon be banned.

Don’t Ignore The Needs of Your Nose,"I know that this one probably sounds ridiculously obvious, but from my experience it is so easy to become lost in the experience and allow even the most common sense practices to fly out of the window. Too many subsequent days of discomfort have taught me to try harder.

Hopefully the following extracts from *The Drug Users Bible* ([download the free PDF here](https://www.reddit.com/r/harmreduction/comments/14ldqyp/download_the_drug_users_bible_from_here/)) might provide a little motivation and help.

NASAL CARE

If you insufflate your drugs it is important that you take sensible precautions and that you perform appropriate aftercare. This particularly applies if you use this method regularly. Maintaining a clean environment and sterile equipment is an obvious requirement, but it is surprising how standards can slip whilst under the influence. 

Regarding the drug itself, assuming of course that all the steps outlined earlier have been undertaken, it is a good idea to check the constitution of the material. For example, is the powder fine enough? Stating the obvious it is wise to avoid snorting crushed pills, not only on this basis but because they often contain fillers, binding agents and other ingredients, which are not well suited to this RoA. 

For nasal irrigation there is a variety of commercial products and tools available. Alternatively, making your own saline solution is a relatively trivial exercise.  In either case regular use of this approach is certainly worth considering. 

[Even my badly stocked local pharmacy had an irrigation option](https://preview.redd.it/xyfrhg1bhngd1.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9a87208c62d95ea68ed96c0910b6d24d3416f35)

The operation itself is simple enough, with a common procedure explained on the UKCR forum: 

>*“The actual practice of nasal lavage is far simpler and less offensive than it might sound. Placing your head over the sink, tilted to one side, insert the nozzle of the bottle into the uppermost nostril, breathe through your mouth and allow the water to pour into your nostril, whereupon it will flow through your nose and out of the other nostril. Sustain this for 20-30 seconds or as long as is comfortable. Tilt your head to the opposite side, and repeat with the other nostril. Once you've used about half the solution, blow your nose and repeat. This should help to flush out any residual grot and minimise damage to the nasal mucosa.“* \~ Magick

Frequency is often a matter of personal preference, but this should not become excessive.  

If you habitually insufflate use common sense. Don’t disregard the needs of your nose. 

COCAINE NOSE

It’s hardly a secret that prolonged use of cocaine can cause (considerable) damage to your nose, nostrils and sinuses. In this respect I would direct you to the segment on nasal care in the first section of this book. I would add to this that you should only snort off a clean surface and only with the use of a clean snorter (and certainly not with a pound note or dollar bill). 

Sharing the snorter (or whatever is used) is also a serious no-no, as it can significantly increase the risk of infection. Again, don’t suspend basic hygiene.

Finally, one step I personally take but which I don’t often see mentioned (perhaps it’s too obvious) is to snort lines using alternate nostrils. Another is to blow your nose properly and fully at the end of the session. ",10,2,2024-08-04 13:44:26,’ ignore needs nose know one probably sounds ridiculously obvious experience easy become lost experience allow even common sense practices fly window many subsequent days discomfort taught try harder hopefully following extracts drug users bible download free pdf https //www.reddit.com/r/harmreduction/comments/14ldqyp/download_the_drug_users_bible_from_here/ might provide little motivation help nasal care insufflate drugs important take sensible precautions perform appropriate aftercare particularly applies use method regularly maintaining clean environment sterile equipment obvious requirement surprising standards slip whilst influence regarding drug assuming course steps outlined earlier undertaken good idea check constitution material example powder fine enough stating obvious wise avoid snorting crushed pills basis often contain fillers binding agents ingredients well suited roa nasal irrigation variety commercial products tools available alternatively making saline solution relatively trivial exercise either case regular use approach certainly worth considering even badly stocked local pharmacy irrigation option https //preview.redd.it/xyfrhg1bhngd1.jpg width=511 format=pjpg auto=webp s=a9a87208c62d95ea68ed96c0910b6d24d3416f35 operation simple enough common procedure explained ukcr forum “ actual practice nasal lavage far simpler less offensive might sound placing head sink tilted one side insert nozzle bottle uppermost nostril breathe mouth allow water pour nostril whereupon flow nose nostril sustain 20-30 seconds long comfortable tilt head opposite side repeat nostril 've used half solution blow nose repeat help flush residual grot minimise damage nasal mucosa. “ \~ magick frequency often matter personal preference become excessive habitually insufflate use common sense ’ disregard needs nose cocaine nose ’ hardly secret prolonged use cocaine cause considerable damage nose nostrils sinuses respect would direct segment nasal care first section book would add snort clean surface use clean snorter certainly pound note dollar bill sharing snorter whatever used also serious no-no significantly increase risk infection ’ suspend basic hygiene cocaine nose https //preview.redd.it/lvqcp7ljhngd1.jpg width=553 format=pjpg auto=webp s=80511553d0eed21b10a5ee8cd160d1ecaa162f8e finally one step personally take ’ often see mentioned perhaps ’ obvious snort lines using alternate nostrils another blow nose properly fully end session

Laced Cocaine and Crack,"Hey folks, as a paramedic, I just wanted to put it out there that I have been seeing an uptick in patients who thought that they were using either cocaine or crack, however their product was laced with both fentanyl and insulin. A coworker of mine had another one today. 

With this combo, you can overdose with the fentanyl, however the insulin will make your blood sugar go very very low. Deadly levels low.  This can cause you to go unconscious and Narcan will not reverse the insulin. 

Please don’t use alone. Carry narcan, and call for EMS if you see someone overdosing!

research article on harm reduction,"is there a way besides  abstinence to keep addicts safe?many people believe the only way for an addict to get better is to begin complete abstinence, but is there another way?



Harm reduction is a viable solution to addiction compared to harsh abstinence.This is because suddenly becoming abstinent can lead to things such as painful withdrawal, and can even lead in death. Harm reduction centers eliminate danger by being  very thorough with drug use and administration.""Harm reduction offers an opportunity to reach people who aren’t otherwise accessing healthcare services ― and offer them naloxone to reverse an overdose, and help connect them to other needed services.



:this shows that harm reduction centers are free and can be lifesaving to struggling addicts with no access to other services.this goes into the next point, which is that we need to start treating addicts more like humans many people do not treat addicts like other humans and barely see them as such, they have zero disregard for them simply because of their lack of proper living conditions, they may seem them as animal like.""Decades of research have shown that some harm reduction strategies provide significant individual and public health benefits including preventing deaths from overdoses and preventing transmission of infectious diseases among people who use drugs and the larger community.""This shows that when they treated addicts like real humans, they were able to stop transmission of a deadly disease and listen death from overdoses



.This goes into the next point of just how helpful harm reduction is.Harm reduction is an INCREDIBLY useful tool in helping unfortunate individuals who are addicted to dangerous drugs by offering them free resources to stay safe/""This potential connection to treatment is critical, when the data show that:Only around one out of ten people with a substance use disorder have received treatment.Nearly all people with a substance use disorder who didn’t get treatment at a specialty facility didn’t think they needed treatment.:this shows just how crucial and important harm reduction is because barely anyone received help for substance use disorder, and harm reduction centers/practices help lead them in the right direction. This goes to show that harm reduction will make a huge impact.In conclusion, harm reduction helps addicts by offering a safer, less harsh, and guiding approach to addiction. This helps humanize them and helps individuals experiencing issues with drug addiction receive the proper treatment.I used many articles to gather information about harm reduction that I did not already know.I believe this is an amazing research topic as it is a serious issue.

How can I be safe (ish) taking fent?,"Before anything I'd really like it if nobody tried to talk me out of using, I'm just looking for safety advice. Also this account is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Hey guys! I am recently doing opiods again and that includes a little bit of knowingly laced stuff and recently I have been occasionally preferring the laced stuff to regular and was trying to look into buying and using fent. 

That being said, fent is obviously really dangerous and supposedly 2mg is a death sentence, so I was wondering what the best way is to measure the dosage that I'm taking is.  I know the pills are supposed to be 100mcg each but is that generally accurate are they ever more or less? How many pills can I safely take generally? Or if I buy 1g of powder what can I expect the purity of it to be, like if I had 1g of powder would1/50th of that really be 2mg?

How to calculate fentanyl dosages?

Pregabalin Seizure Risk,"Hi there! I'd like to share my research about pregabalin and raise awareness of its seizure concerns. The below demonstrates that Pregabalin has seizure concerns and greater information about it.

Pregabalin has been shown to induce and or increase the risk of seizures at recreational dosages. There is little evidence showing there is a concern at medical dosages (600mg and under). This risk may be increased when mixed with other drugs that lower seizure threshold. Caution is recommended when using doses of higher than 600mg. Reducing various susceptibility factors may also be beneficial in lowering this risk. Susceptibility factors may include things such as low sodium, lack of sleep, and intensive physical activity.

: Advice needed for persistent symptoms after substance use [Serious],"Hey Reddit, I'm looking for some guidance on a sensitive situation. A friend is experiencing some concerning symptoms after using a stimulant substance (m\*th) last Friday (it's now Monday). I'm hoping someone here might have some insight or advice.

**Symptoms:**

* Increased heart rate that's still persisting
* Spasms at the back of the head, especially when exercising
* These symptoms have been ongoing since Friday morning

**Additional context:**

* Located in a country where there's significant stigma around substance use
* Concerned about seeking medical help due to potential legal/social consequences

Has anyone experienced something similar or have any advice on what to do? Are these symptoms something to be really worried about? Any insights on how to get help discreetly would be appreciated.

Edit: To be clear, I'm not looking for medical advice to replace seeing a doctor. Just trying to understand the urgency/severity and options for getting help safely.",5,7,2024-07-08 02:21:19,advice needed persistent symptoms substance use serious hey reddit 'm looking guidance sensitive situation friend experiencing concerning symptoms using stimulant substance m\ th last friday 's monday 'm hoping someone might insight advice symptoms increased heart rate 's still persisting spasms back head especially exercising symptoms ongoing since friday morning additional context located country 's significant stigma around substance use concerned seeking medical help due potential legal/social consequences anyone experienced something similar advice symptoms something really worried insights get help discreetly would appreciated edit clear 'm looking medical advice replace seeing doctor trying understand urgency/severity options getting help safely

Doing without abusing? ,"Hi all, I am curious what others opinions and experiences are on having drug dependency issues but still using drug that you have had dependency issues with. 

3 years ago I got off using cocaine hard. I was consumed by the drug and my life was dependent on it. I got clean on it and then over the last years I go through periods of having it and not having it. 

When I don’t have it I am fine. But I find when I have it for a while I find myself going back into habits of doing a bump here and there. 
I don’t blow down lines like I used too. But when I have it I’ll avg doing a few lines throughout the day. 

I want to get to the point where I feel like I can have it on me without doing it. 

Currently I struggle with setting a goal to not do it. And then later on my other brain will find the excuse to do it. And I don’t necessarily think it’s unhealthy but it’s also not healthy. 

My mindset on the consumption goes back and forth. I’m curious what others opinions are on this? 

I don’t want to not ever do the drug, but I also want to feel like I self control that when I set a goal my other brain doesn’t override the goal I set. 

Thank you for listening 🫶",9,8,2024-06-29 02:44:20,without abusing hi curious others opinions experiences drug dependency issues still using drug dependency issues 3 years ago got using cocaine hard consumed drug life dependent got clean last years go periods ’ fine find find going back habits bump ’ blow lines like used ’ avg lines throughout day want get point feel like without currently struggle setting goal later brain find excuse ’ necessarily think ’ unhealthy ’ also healthy mindset consumption goes back forth ’ curious others opinions ’ want ever drug also want feel like self control set goal brain ’ override goal set thank listening 🫶

Fentanyl: Let's Talk About Google,"This might be old news, but I've just discovered it, and I'm still a bit like... WTF?

I searched on Google for some test trips, using the words\*: fentanyl test strip\*. I was confronted with a stack of government and similar pages offering a range of scientific-like information.

Fine, but this was not what I wanted. So I tried again by selecting '*Products*'. I did, after all, want to buy a product.

[Fentanyl Test Strip](https://preview.redd.it/jk3rubwrri8d1.jpg?width=1348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1778b0e5e192d283985c30dd4adf3be63287688c)

Seriously?

Test strips are available from a wide variety of suppliers, and can even be found on Amazon, so they are obviously filtering here. There are MANY suitable matches for this search.

In a nutshell, if someone wants to practice harm reduction by testing their drugs, Google is filtering the results which might very well save their lives.

Conclusion, other than the obvious re Google? 

Use *DuckDuckGo*, which presents a significant number of options.

"""Knocking down a high"" with Narcan on the street?","I work in a street outreach program in an urban setting. We distribute Narcan and offer training in how to use it. An outreach worker from another organization who has more street experience than me did something I found strange and I wanted to get a read on it from a wider group.

Two women were walking up the street and stopped to talk to the outreach worker (call him T) for about 10 minutes. One of the women then started to nod out, bend at the waist, and hang there, still standing. T grabbed her and tried to muscle her around to spray Narcan in her nose.  He had to get someone else to help hold her. She never hit the ground. He was muscling her around a lot trying to get a good angle on her. She woke up and hen walked away with her friend under her own power after maybe getting a little Narcan in her , maybe not. (I couldn't see from where I was.)

When I asked why T was Narcanning someone who was still conscious, he said, ""Oh, I saved her life. I save 10 lives a day like that. She was so high. I was knocking down her high a little bit."") None of that made sense to  me. She was standing up. And T did not shake her or shout at her, which would have been my first move. T has more street experience than I do and I realize that there's the handbook, and then there's real life. But it all just felt off to me, like he kind of wants to be in the role of ""saving"" someone and is using Narcan unnecessarily.  

What do others make of this? I have been taught that someone is mostly likely to OD right after shooting up, and that the level of fentanyl in their system is steadily declining after that, so the risk of OD is getting lowered with time. So if someone is walking around for 30 minutes, they aren't going to suddenly overdose at that point - they'll nod out, but you're unlikely to see them OD 30 minutes later.  Is that accurate?

Naloxone before opioid use?,"Hello, I am a person in long-term recovery who also works in recovery.  I work with some clients who have no plans of stopping use, but are also hoping not to OD.

I understand that use of Naloxone can revive someone experiencing an opiate OD, but what happens if someone uses Naloxone just before they decide to use?

I am thinking mostly about people who use something other than an opiate (like cocaine, meth, etc.) that is laced with an opiate like Fentanyl.  As an example, if someone chooses to use cocaine and desires its effects, but does not want to be effected by an opiate, will using Naloxone reduce or eliminate the chances of an OD.  I should probably know the answer to this question, but have had difficulty finding an answer online.",22,53,2024-06-18 18:48:08,naloxone opioid use hello person long-term recovery also works recovery work clients plans stopping use also hoping od understand use naloxone revive someone experiencing opiate od happens someone uses naloxone decide use thinking mostly people use something opiate like cocaine meth etc laced opiate like fentanyl example someone chooses use cocaine desires effects want effected opiate using naloxone reduce eliminate chances od probably know answer question difficulty finding answer online
Weigh Your Gear / How To Use Drug Scales,"I know what some of you may be thinking: this is really basic and obvious, right? Well… not exactly. For example, I for one always wondered what *tare* meant on my first set.    

So here goes, as extracted from *The Drug Users Bible*:

>Invest in, and use, some milligram (0.001g) scales. It should be obvious that dosing is a central issue, and that many chemicals are extremely dose sensitive, including at low levels. Don’t scrimp on or bypass this matter under any circumstances.

> *A quick layman’s guide on how to use your scales:*  
*·  Take the pan off your scales and turn them on.*  
*·  Place the pan back on the scales. It will show a weight, perhaps something like 2.671g.*  
*·  Press the tare button, and then remove the pan.*  
*·  The scale will now read -2.671, or whatever the weight of the pan was.*  
*·  Place the substance in the pan, and place the pan back on the scales.*  
*·  The scales will now show the weight of the substance.*

>Bear in mind here that most scales are not precise enough to weigh accurately at the individual milligram level, but do tend to be reasonable for perhaps units of 10mg. If the intended dose is in the single milligram range, you will need a set of high quality scales or a set of microgram scales.

>For smaller doses, perhaps of less than 1mg, or in the low milligram range, an approach known as *volumetric dosing* is commonly used. This involves dissolving a known quantity of a compound into a liquid, and then measuring the dose by millilitre, via the mg/ml ratio created.  

>For substances that do not dissolve in water, liquids such as alcohol or propylene glycol are used. It is worth remembering that the lower the concentration of the substance in the liquid, the easier and safer it is to dose.

>*TripSit* offers an excellent guide to volumetric dosing on its website: wiki.tripsit(dot)me/wiki/Quick\_Guide\_to\_Volumetric\_Dosing

>One last word on dosing: caution and concentration are vital. Take all sensible measures when handling chemicals, preferably using gloves and eye protection.

Note that the first part of this applies to common and basic scales like my beloved Gemini-20, and some of you may have more complex fangled apparatus.

Regardless of how you do it though: **always weigh your gear**.

US Survey Study: Seeking information on how you access overdose prevention and safe drug use supplies,"***This survey has been approved by the moderators.***

Hi everyone,

My name is Jazmine Li, a Senior Research Assistant at Weill Cornell Medicine, and I am writing on behalf of my team for the HOME (Harm reduction services Offered through Mail-delivery Expansion) study led by Dr. Czarina Behrends. Our study website can be found here: [https://homeharmredux.com/](https://homeharmredux.com/)

**Overview:** HOME is a National Institute of Health funded study that aims to understand the use of harm reduction services (i.e. syringe/needle exchange, naloxone/Narcan, other safe use supplies, etc.) nationally by people who use drugs in the United States. This study will contribute to understanding what type of harm reduction service delivery works best for different types of people, specifically the role of mail-based harm reduction services. This study has been approved by the Weill Cornell IRB and all efforts will be made to protect your confidentiality.

**Participation:** We are recruiting approximately 1,200 persons who use drugs. We are looking for people who will complete a total of **six \~15-minute online surveys over the course of 18 months. You can receive between $15-40 online for every survey completed.**

**Eligibility:** We are looking for individuals over the age of 18 who are located within the United States and can remain in the study for the full 18-month period. Participants must be able to read and write in English or Spanish and have never used mail-based harm reduction services before.

If you or someone you know is interested in joining our study, please complete this [survey](https://weillcornell.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aVpiglBvNQBkBQG?TrackSource=&AdNum=R_Harmreduction) to see if you can participate.

"Hormones, brain chemicals, neurological reliance, alcohol","Hi! I just joined so I haven't read other posts, but I thought I'd ask a few questions to those more seasoned in the harm reduction approach. 

I've struggled with binge-drinking (between 4-8 days in a row) just before and during menstruation, for 8+ years. In March I was alcohol free for 26 days, but then the PMDD (severe premenstrual symptoms) hits and I have insomnia, rage, exhaustion, etc. so bad for sometimes up to 20 days (if my period is late) and I just lose it. I have bad PTSD from being raised in an abusive cult and family, but I'm spiritually driven, love my career, know my life purpose, and generally want to experience more in life, but I struggle with agoraphobia and panic disorder. 

That being said, I just completed another 25 days without drinking, but after two weeks of insomnia (and trying EVERYTHING: Gabapentin, Ambien, finished off some benzos, low-dose kratom, natural sleeping aids, and herbs for PMDD) but f\*#@ing nothing was working! 

So now my intuition (and education, I'm nearly finished with a master's degree in Counseling), and an understanding of neuroplasticity, is making me wonder if when progesterone is high (PMDD) then both progesterone and estrogen drop (menstruation) it affects the serotonin and GABA in my brain (obviously) but that there is still WITHDRAWAL from the alcohol at that point in the cycle???

Because I've genuinely been trying not to drink. And I haven't binged this cycle (I drank one night, 3 nights ago, now I'm drinking as I write this \[two sips so far\]) because I'm on day 2 of my period and I am having a migraine (I never get headaches), anxiety, and nausea. 

Do you guys think that withdrawals can happen cyclically? 

I'm going to go with yes and try and do harm reduction again so my brain knows it's still receiving a source of GABA-goodness, but not to the point of frying it (or dying lol, funny but not funny). 

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Is boofing dmt physically safe? What about 5-meo-dmt?,"I can't seem to find any information on the safety of boofing DMT and 5-meo-dmt. The wikipedia page for dmt (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine) lists rectal under routes of administration, but doesn't cite a source. [https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route\_of\_administration#Rectal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration#Rectal) mentions that some substances shouldn't be boofed since they're caustic, how do you know if a given substance is caustic? I've seen some substances also come in different forms like freebase, hcl, and hbr, does that make a difference?

My first thought is that any substance that can be insufflated ""safely"" could also be boofed with the same level of risk. Is that true?

Sorry if this has been answered, but like I said I really can't seem to find any definitive info on this, and I've searched a good amount.

Go-bags for MAT inmates,"Today was a very important day for me as a Social Worker!

I work in a Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) program inside a jail, helping people who are incarcerated and are struggling with addiction to heroin/fentanyl. A common theme I’ve learned is that some of these folks are without the basics in the community. I decided I wanted those people to have access to essentials once they’re released. I researched then petitioned the Department of Human Services to help fund this project. I was met with smiles, open arms and money!

After 2 years of planning and advocacy, this project of mine is finally ready for take-off. Upon release from jail, those in my MAT program will now receive this go-bag which consists of:

Narcan!
Fentanyl testing strips
An emergency blanket
A poncho
First aid kit
Condoms
Menstrual pads for women
Sunscreen
GoodRx cards
Toothbrush & toothpaste
Resources that can link folks to housing, treatment centers, peer lines and any other community support someone may need

The opioid epidemic and how to combat it is a controversial topic. However, I believe it’s the little things that can help to eventually make an impact. I want these folks to know that despite battling addiction and having been incarcerated, their lives still matter.

Originally, I had a picture with the final product but it’s not allowed. 

EDIT TO ADD: I thank you all for the kind word but especially your suggestions. My hope is that I can add even more items as time goes on!!

Second: is there a way to tell if I accidentally was sent the wrong RC? Should I do fent strips on my o-dsmt? Is there a place I can send my o-dsmt in for them to test for zene's and other stuff?

Third: is it good for chronic pain?

Fourth: how is it like combining with kratom?

Fifth: any other pertinent things I should know from it? I plan on starting with weighing 10mg on my scale, mixing it with water, then  ingesting to see it's effects then slowly scale up.

Crack and surgery? Silly question,"Hi y'all this is probably a dumb question but oh well, whenever I try to be open about drug use related stuff with my doctors they never know the answer to my questions.

Anyway, I'm planning to have a major surgery in the next few months, I haven't gotten a date yet but probably some time around December.

I'm assuming that I need to fully quit smoking crack at some point before the surgery, do y'all think I should follow the same rules as for nicotine? Meaning like I need to completey stop for 6 weeks before until 6 weeks after the surgery? Or is there any reason that I need to stop sooner and stay abstinent from it for longer than 6 weeks? I really don't wanna fuck up the surgery or the scars... But I haven't really seen a lot of info out there about cocaine and anesthesia or cocaine's effects on scarring... So anything y'all can offer would be really REALLY greatly appreciated ❤️❤️❤️

Weed as harm reduction for alcohol,"I searched the sub and found a few past posts, but nothing substantial. I was surprised by this. Anyway, I love the harm reduction ethos, and I wanted to share my own experience and ask this community a couple of questions. I'm new here, so please lmk if I've violated any rules.

I am 36 years old. For twelve years, I've lived a cycle of alcohol abuse and sobriety. I have both suffered the whole time and worked very, very hard the whole time, and it always came to nothing except the next trip through the cycle. I had reached the point where I figured I would just continue to suffer and work hard for nothing until it killed me in my forties.

But then I found weed. This was a year ago. Alcohol cravings are a thing of the past. I'm slightly high all the time now; I take 30 mg of edibles spaced throughout the day, every day. I live a stable, sustainable lifestyle for the first time in my entire existence (rough childhood, rough adulthood so far). Obviously, I know it's not good that I'm taking a drug. It would be better if I could not take a drug. But compared to what I had before I discovered weed, this is a night-and-day improvement for me. Negative side effects are minimal. There are a ton of positive side effects, though, such as increased space between me and my feelings, and improved ability to focus and sustain motivation long term. I finally have space, time, and stability to sort myself out. Literally, the harm to me from my own actions has been massively reduced. You can't even compare the harm of an alcohol-sobriety-cycle lifestyle to the harm of a weed lifestyle, for me, because those two harms can't be measured on the same scale.

My questions include:

--Why don't more alcoholics do this???? It works so well I still sometimes wonder if maybe I died in a drunk driving accident and I've been placed in a nice soft purgatory where all my problems are less intense. (I'm exaggerating to convey my feelings lol, I don't literally believe that).

--Is there something I'm missing? Something negative about weed that I'll discover eventually? The worst thing I've dealt with has been some constipation. Other than that, weed is literally all upside. It's hard to believe.

--Does anyone know of any communities, online or otherwise, that support/openly discuss the use of weed as a harm reduction technique for alcoholism?

--If anyone is in the same boat, what are some techniques you have for ensuring that taking this drug is as healthy as it's possible to be?

--Since I have found some peace in something that might be considered ""harm reduction,"" I now have an urge to give back to ""harm reduction."" What might the best ways to do that be? There's a needle distribution center in my city, but it's staffed pretty much exclusively by sober opiate addicts, and I fear they would just be confused by me trying to get involved.

NEW SUBSTANCE FOUND IN DOPE! Medetomidine-a stronger tranq ,"Medetomidine

The Basics:

* A tranquilizer similar to xylazine 
* Found in the philly drug supply for the first time at the end of April 2024
* Clinical purposes:
   * induces sedation
   * an analgesic: causes an inability to feel pain
   * an anxioltic: causes a level of sedation associated with extreme relaxation but may not be awake & may not be able to respond
   * muscle relaxation 
* At this time, all samples containing medetomidine also contained xylazine & fentanyl.

Similarities to xylazine aka tranq:

* Medetomidine is an apha 2 agonist
* Causes significant sedation
* Causes vasoconstriction
   * Will slow healing of wounds
* Causes respiratory depression
* Causes dry mouth
* Not approved for human use but unlike xylazine does have a version that is approved for use in humans known as dextromedetomidine

Differences between medetomidine & xylazine aka tranq:

* Causes muscle twitches\*
* Can cause hallucinations\*
* Causes peripheral cyanosis - can turn skin colors, but person isn’t truly cyanotic (without oxygen)\*
* Medetomidine is considered to be stronger than xylazine and has a longer duration of action which means that it lasts longer than xylazine.
* Medetomidine causes an increase in urination which leads to dehydration and an increase in overdose risk.
* There is a form of medetomidine that is approved for use in humans known as dexmedetomidine aka precedex.
* There are currently no testing strips to identify the presence of medetomidine in the drug supply.

\*Symptoms not found with xylazine use. 

Adverse Effects:

* Deep state of unconsciousness
* Respiratory depression
* Cardiac & Circulatory depression 
* Dry mouth
* Dilated pupils
* Hypothermia-low body temperature 
* Muscle spasms 
* Low heart rate
* High blood pressure followed by prolonged low blood pressure 
* Peripheral vasoconstriction - turns skin blue; can mask actual cyanosis (lack of oxygen within the body)

Responding to an overdose involving medetomidine:

* Though medetomidine is not an opioid and will not respond to naloxone, it has been found in combination with fentanyl and therefore, the use of naloxone is still recommended
* Rescue breathing is essential 
* Utilize the rescue position 
* Management of body temperature 
   * use of cooling measures like wet paper towels
* Encourage hydration to reduce risk of kidney damage

If you think there might be medetomidine in your supply, follow universal precautions! 

* ALWAYS CARRY NALOXONE
* Try not to use alone
* Start low & go slow. You can always do more but you can’t do less. 

Medetomidine-Summary

* Found in the Philly drug supply in April of 2024.
* Similar to xylazine but has a longer duration of action.
* Causes muscle twitches & hallucations which can act as a red flag for the presence of medetomidine in your supply.
* Hydration & managing body temperature as well as oxygenation are essential. 
* Follow universal precauations!

Health question about mdma pure,"**Health question:** 

On a daily basis, sober, I have tachycardia throughout the day(about 110-130 BMP/minute). 

On the other hand, I've been thinking hard lately about taking pure MDMA (no pills involved) during a party,possibly in a classic mix with THC.

I have to admit that the tests have always been clean and I have never been diagnosed with any heart disease. On the other hand, I know that this substance is not inert to the heart, while the level of danger to the HEALTHY user is not, to my eye. scary( I may be slightly misinformed).

I also have in stock a heart medication-Betaloc ZOK ("" 47.5 mg of metoprolol succinate"") that used to help me with my overactive heart, the idea is to take it on the day of the event to relieve the heart muscle,while I have no idea about the interaction with the aforementioned MDMA and THC,especially that according to research information such a MIX is able to increase the excitation of the heart.

Am i cooked?,"Last weekend i did around 0.3-4g of yayo over a couple hours and my friend noticed my pupils were very different sizes, google wasnt very helpful so i stopped for the night and they went back to normal. The next day i did two lines and everything was fine. This weekend we did some more and it happened again, my friend said that it might be that i was only using one nostril so i tried doing it evenly on both nostrils and timing it out evenly. My pupils have been normal aside from the occasional delayed reaction of one eye. I feel healthy in every other way and relative to my other experiences i dont feel in danger.

Then I was having weight issues, so I swapped most nights to vodka o clock and that certainly didn't help and I noticed around October that I had a hard time just stopping for one night. So I went into a program with Ria, medication with naltrexone, and surely enough helped immensely!

I did Dry January and found it incredibly helpful resetting my brain and process on alcohol. I think of it a reset and detox. Now I decided for myself to do dry months every three months, so January, May, and September, and between months to really focus on harm reduction, moderation, and not overdoing it with alcohol.

Random Recovery Tips From An Ageing Psychonaut,"*What is it like being old and taking drugs? What is different compared to taking them when younger? Are there any differences at all?*

Yes there are. In fact, depending upon the drug in question, quite a few changes come with experience and age; but the most obvious physical manifestation relates to recovery. Recovery is often a much slower process, and is sometimes more challenging. This post explores and expands upon these aspects, with reference to my own exposure.

[An Old Psychonaut](https://preview.redd.it/lyevub99xtwc1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbacaa9ac188c95902ed8ac878e078dcce1678de)

**TRY TO BE FIT**

First things first: not only am I old enough to remember *The Beatles*, but I self-administered [182 different drugs](https://drugusersbible.org/content/worldscape/argot/alphabetical_index/index.html) between 2008 and 2023. As many of you know, during this period I wrote *The Drug Users Bible*.

I was, however, in decent shape, despite the sedentary lifestyle of spending most of the day on my PC writing. During the first 10 years, when not away on an  expedition, I went to the local swimming pool every morning for an unimpressive eight lengths, and then engaged various stretches to keep my ageing body supple and strong (lol).  When the pool closed due to COVID I had to adjust, walking an hour or two every day instead. I lost weight and became fitter, and I believe that the enhanced fitness helped to sustain my drug-taking lifestyle.

**PHYSICAL RECOVERY**

To the direct topic in hand though; walking is particularly good for recovery following a heavy session with certain drugs. It aids circulation, helps digestion, promotes better sleep, and produces a whole raft of other related benefits.

For myself, this was especially notable with speed, but it applied to many other drugs too, including mephedrone, methamphetamine and MDMA.

Recovery from a session should ideally be pre-planned (check-out *rollsafe.org*). Commonly cited recovery aids include:

* General re-hydration
* Drinking orange/fruit juice
* Eating healthy meals, including food/drinks with electrolytes
* Careful use of supplements
* Plenty of rest/relaxation and showers.

Sleep is another: get as much as possible. If it has been a particularly excessive binge I have sometimes used a suitable sleep aid.

Some people suggest a toke of cannabis to ease the discomfort and stimulate appetite. Yes, I have occasionally taken this course, and I usually found it to be helpful (again depending upon the drug I was recovering from).

**MENTAL RECOVERY**

This is an important one: it helps to be aware that for a few days life can be coloured by the aftermath of the drug experience. Everything can look bleaker than it did previously. A real sense of depression can emerge. In severe cases you might even become distressed and, from time to time, feel like crying. Yes; your entire existence can seem to be absolutely shit.

[A Difficult Aftermath](https://preview.redd.it/enn65clbxtwc1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=228ad586e0044e5642a85ea4c33643363f7d47dc)

What can help with this, apart from the practical physical steps above?

Knowing why this is happening (the drug) certainly helps: basically, knowing that it will pass. One trick is to focus upon a point in time 72 or 96 hours ahead: understanding that you will be generally happier at that juncture. You just have to get through those days. This is a mental exercise but it can really help to have a target.

BTW: One thing you don’t do is head back to the same (or a similar) drug.

I would also avoid making any serious life decisions whilst your mood is artificially low. If you are able to, delay anything of this nature until you are fully recovered. Do take this advice seriously.

Finally, if you need emotional or any similar support, don’t hesitate to seek it out. A problem shared isn’t exactly a problem halved, but it does help some people.

**LOOK AFTER YOURSELF**

Generally a young healthy body is likely to recover from physical problems faster than an old healthy body, and this definitely applies to drugs. Fortunately I have found that all the above suggestions apply regardless of age. It just takes longer as you get older, and the aches and pains are more obvious.

If you are ageing, take a little more care of yourself, and prepare for, and factor-in, a harsher aftermath and an extended recuperation period.

I will end on a positive note though, so roll the drums: here comes the good news… drugs don’t stop being fun when you are old

When is it okay to self medicate with weed?,"Hiya everybody, 

Looking for a way to set ground rules for myself that are more helpful, useful, and healthy. I (24M) am getting closer and closer to not smoking by the day. Problem is i smoke to aleviate anxiety before bed. I am aware that this disturbs my natural sleep cycle and i dont fuckin care. I would rather have shit sleep than absolutely none. I get terrifying, disgusting, gorey nightmares and they are so fucking real. Ive been having these dreams since i was 9 and i do not want more. Fuck that. Is it a reasonable and conscious decision to smoke only when i am at the brink of acute stress? I cant imagine smoking for just a little stress is healthy yk? I want to take care of myself and im just not sure how to handle the next step.

Ill add more context below if youre seeking it.

*TLDR;* The main beef of this dish is that i still rely on weed as a last resort for my mental issues and spiralling thoughts. At a certain point the pain teaches me nothing and its healthier for me to abandon that train of thought so i can make more beneficial decisions. But i am growing out of weed as i have tried more and more to not smoke. When is it going to be beneficial for me to smoke and when is it an unhealthy decision?


CONTEXT: 

I have ptsd and i spiral pretty bad into anxiety and stressful fantasy. My imagination has always been impeccably vivid which most people would consider a gift and a blessing, but unfortunately its weaponized against me. They are visions, the world around me disappears and i retreat to absolutely nowhere. Suddenly that imaginary setting is projected to my vision and I honest to fucking god cant see. Its so fucking upsetting because they are NEVER good. Its always something fucking horrible, i can never have it easy, a fight, confronting my r*pist, ways myself and everyone else can die, horrible ways to die, should i go on? Probably not. Its disturbing. 

I smoke to stop panic attacks, that was how it started. Quickly snowballed into a porn addiction and i had to claw my way back to real life. You might be reading this thinking im just a dramatic loser guy but i mean i had a serious fucking problem. Called out of work, built and destroyed plans with friends, coupled with being high almost constantly, just to watch porn for 10 hours straight. Okay? Okay. I am doing much better and i have a system that meets me where im at and im constantly improving. I dont want it to just stagnate until it gets so bad im forced to get better again. I want to continually move toward this goal however long it takes with the foundation of trusting myself. Im not ready to stop smoking yet and i dont want to stop yet. But i want to get better, and i want to want it someday. I honestly really do prefer sobriety but i felt i had no other choice.

I have a psychologist and a psychiatrist and they are both amazing doctors. I have ADHD, Ptsd, depression, and anxiety. I do have that medicine to stop nightmares but honestly it doesnt really help me. It actually prompted nightmares for me for a while there. Really fucking sucked and was massively disappointed.

"""Overcoming Stigma, Ending Discrimination"" - SAMHSA","#RESOURCE GUIDE  

• The Addictionary. The Recovery Research Institute developed [a glossary of over 200 top addiction-related words defined](https://www.recoveryanswers.org/addiction-ary/), to help medical professionals and the general public modify their language about addiction. Watch for (stigma alert) items.  

• Ending Discrimination Against People with Mental and Substance Use Disorders: The Evidence for Stigma Change. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) asked the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to undertake [a study of the science of stigma change](https://doi.org/10.17226/23442).  

• Changing the Language of Addiction. This [memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/Memo%20-%20Changing%20Federal%20Terminology%20Regrading%20Substance%20Use%20and%20Substance%20Use%20Disorders.pdf) from former Director of The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), Michael Botticelli, highlights the relationship between language and stigma.

• Words Matter: How Language Choice Can Reduce Stigma. Developed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies (CAPT), [this training resource](https://www.samhsa.gov/capt/sites/default/files/resources/sud-stigma-tool.pdf) examines the role of language in perpetuating SUD stigma, offers tips to assess how and when we may be using stigmatizing language, and steps to ensure that we use language that is positive, productive, and inclusive.

• In 2015, the International Society of Addiction Journal Editors released a [consensus statement](http://www.isaje.net/addiction-terminology.html) recommending against the use of stigmatizing terminology, most notably “abuse” and “abuser,” in published addiction science.  

• The Associated Press included a new entry on addiction and revised drug-related entries in the new edition of its widely-used [AP Stylebook](https://partnershealthcare.sharepoint.com/sites/CAM-RRI/SAMHSA%20Webcast%20Series/2018.03.28%20-%20Webcast%201/o%09https:/www.ap.org/press-releases/2017/data-journalism-chapter-debuts-in-2017-ap-stylebook).  

• The Real Stigma of Substance Use Disorders: Does it Matter How We Talk About People with Substance Use Disorder? Dr. Kelly’s 2010 research tested two different ways of referring to someone dealing with addiction, turning up [important results](https://www.recoveryanswers.org/research-post/the-real-stigma-of-substance-use-disorders/) for our understanding of language and addiction.

• Kelly, Saitz, and Wakeman (2015) summarize the [public health need to reduce the perpetuation of the stigma](http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343\(14\)00770-0/pdf) surrounding addiction, a major barrier to treatment access, through language; in other words, to “stop talking dirty”. The authors go on to detail the [conceptual and empirical basis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07347324.2016.1113103) (2016) for the need to avoid using certain terms and to reach consensus on an “addictionary”, concluding`that consistent use of agreed-upon terminology will aid precise and unambiguous clinical and scientific communication and help reduce stigmatizing and discriminatory public health and social policies.  

• Confronting Inadvertent Stigma & Pejorative Language in Addiction Scholarship. Broyles and colleagues make an appeal for the use of language that gives dignity and respect to those suffering from substance use disorders.  

• Stigma Among Healthcare Professionals Related to Substance Use Disorders: Systematic Reviews of Consequences and Interventions. Van Boekel and colleagues summarized the existing science on health professionals’ attitudes toward individuals with substance use disorder, and the impact of any negative attitudes on healthcare delivery and outcomes. In a related systematic review, Livingston and colleagues outlined results of studies focused on strategies to reduce stigma not only in health professionals but also for those with substance use disorder and the general public.`

OTC products for wound care?,"(Disclaimer: not asking for direct medical advice. Asking for suggestions for over the counter products to help mitigate risk of infection)

Someone close to me is a crack/fent addict who is in the process of recovery (doesn’t shoot anymore but still smokes/snorts). 

He has a bunch of sores (small ones mostly on his arms) that he keeps picking at to “get the bugs out”. From what I understand, the bug sensation is a hallucination and the sores are from xylazine the fentanyl is cut with.

Are there any over the counter creams/medications that will help with the healing process? I know I can’t stop him from picking at them but I’m wondering if there’s anything I can get him that would help mitigate the risk of serious infection.

🚨 Important Notice: DrugsData Temporarily Halts New Sample Submissions - Discussing the Implications 🚨,"Hello Community,

I just discovered that DrugsData, a crucial service in our fight for safer drug use, is not accepting new sample submissions as of April 10, 2024. This pause is due to unexpected administrative or regulatory issues, with no clear timeline for when services will resume. [Here's the notice for reference](https://drugsdata.org/send_stop.php).

Given the rising concern over substances like fentanyl contaminating the drug supply, the timing couldn't be worse. This service has been a lifeline for many in the community, helping to prevent overdoses by providing essential information about what substances actually contain.

**Why is this happening?** It's unclear why this pause is in effect, but it's concerning that it might lead to a lack of access to vital testing services. This could increase the risk of accidental overdoses, especially with the prevalence of fentanyl.

**What can we do?**

* **Discuss Alternatives**: Are there other reliable testing services we can turn to during this pause?
* **Spread Awareness**: The more people know about the importance of testing, the better.
* **Advocate**: Perhaps it’s time to voice our concerns to representatives or support organizations advocating for harm reduction policies.

The need for drug testing services is more critical than ever, and I believe it's important we talk about how this affects our community and what steps we can take next.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and suggestions. Let's keep each other safe and informed!

Thoughts ?,"Mental health crisis / harm reduction 

So as we all know we are in a mental health crisis, and in my line of work I see a lot of drug related crime and psychosis. After recent events, i feel like it would be beneficial to have vending machines at harm reduction centres that have free packets of seroquel and abilify. It could take the pressure of the CATT team and mental health services. I have seen many addicts that have been up for days and days committing crimes and this could prevent some harm to the community.
What do you guys think?

"Rural harm reduction question 
","I am a rural outreach worker. We have a few good local cops who will meet with me to try to find solutions to upcoming bylaws. It affords us the opportunity to develop a program of sorts before arrests start happening. Anyhoo. .we met yesterday and they have to start cracking down on shopping carts. The business owners have offered to donate a few older carts if we can find a way to keep the new fleet from being taken.  Even when they get the carts back, they're too damaged to use. Most end up in the lake.   These aren't big box stores. These folx keep our food banks stocked and give back to our community. It's starting to get personal. This is also the first year this town has had to face its homeless population and they are NOT a supportive town. Theres sooo much hate.  So we need to maintain our few allies.  
I have a few ideas but nothing concrete. I'm hoping someone here has organized something similar and can share rather than trying to reinvent the wheel! 
I've reached out to the community themselves (nothing about us without us) and they identified the flaws in my thinking but didn't have any suggestions so ...I'm throwing it out to you.

"Philly drug use, xylazine ","This is kinda an exclusive question for people familiar and using in the Philly area because I don't believe other places ""heroin"" supply has so much xylazine and things in it to the degree that that area does. If you're injecting it and miss, it cuts off the oxygen to the tissue and causes necrosis. You see so much people there losing limbs and have all kinds of open severe wounds due to this. So my question is, if someone is injecting and missing all the time and causing all these severe wounds, would injecting in the muscle be better? Normally I would think it's fine, but with the xylazine I'm not sure if it would just do the same thing with causing necrosis in the muscle and cause a deeper issue. Anyone know people who are doing this and results or problems they've had from it? One person I talked to had said they were doing it in their muscle and eventually it would cause like a hard spot you could feel if you palpated there but that was it and didn't cause any infections or problems.

"My idol Anthony Green proving to me once again he’s not only an amazing person, but also a great advocate for harm reduction. He wrote this on the insert of his latest vinyl release","My idol Anthony Green proving to me once again he’s not only an amazing person, but also a great advocate for harm reduction. He wrote this statement on the topic on the insert of his latest vinyl release:

You can see the image of the insert I took [here](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/pyq9cnwaw54.jpeg) but it says: 

>“As a person in recovery who has lost loved ones to opioid overdose, Anthony Green had been affected by the stigma and pain that comes with substance use disorder. That’s why he is encouraging his fans to use harm reduction measures if they plan to use drugs – like fentanyl test strips.

>-Definition: Fentanyl testing strips should be used to test ALL substances. Test strips come with detailed instructions, but remember that there are two letters in the word “NO”: two lines means no fentanyl. It is important to test every dose, as fentanyl is often distributed unevenly in the supply.

>-Where to get them: DanceSafe is one of the most utilized resources for obtaining test strips. If test strips are cost-prohibitive, check out Next Distro, as well as harm reduction agencies near you. Test strips are often available for free at local harm reduction, nonprofits and syringe services like The Everywhere Project.”

As someone who’s lost several people to fucked up or fent “heroin” I really appreciated seeing this. What I’m referring to is the set of paragraphs on the lower left side.

I wish there were more celebrities that would preach this instead of bs abstinence… Then maybe we could make some progress, show harm reduction is an effective tool. I feel like it’s these little things that will eventually help us get to a world where “supervised injection sites” will be… fully actualized I guess. Happy to see that there are at least several virtual overdose monitoring services popping up! That’s progress!

Anyways, hope you’re all having a good week!

A Super-Fast Shortcut To Acute Nicotine Poisoning [Mapacho],"*Other than through casual experimentation, I’ve never smoked regular cigarettes. I was thus wholly unprepared to have my head blown off via horrendous experiences with mapacho, rapé & authentic snus.*

A couple of horrors with the first of these are described below, taken word for word from [The Drug Users Bible](https://www.drugusersbible.com). It’s not something I would recommend to anyone.

# EXCERPT:

Mapacho (nicotiana rustica) has a rich history of entheogenic use, primarily amongst South American shamans, and sometimes during ayahuasca ceremonies. It is not to be confused with common tobacco (nicotiana tabacum), not least because its nicotine content is commonly stated to be about 20 times higher.

[ Nicotiana Rustica. As imported from Brazil ](https://preview.redd.it/496x9lu9npoc1.jpg?width=5312&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f044d5c639148a4cbca612e88df83bf319c9f26)

My experience with this was, shall we say, not successful. Perhaps being a non-smoker didn't help, but it was a sorry story.

**REPORT #1**

I undertook the experiment at about 6pm. I loaded the leaves, still pungent and fresh, into a large bong, and took two enormous hits. I'm not sure why I was so greedy: perhaps it was the foolish notion that it was *only tobacco*.

It was a pretty rough smoke, and then boom: I was suddenly dizzy and was almost falling over as I slumped towards a soft chair. I thought I might pass out, but I didn't.

I felt rough, very rough, with head spinning and a sense of nausea.

This gradually wore off and I returned to some sort of normality in about 15-20 minutes. I didn't fully recover until the next day, and I had a very poor night’s sleep.

I was completely overwhelmed by it, and vowed never to smoke it again. It didn't feel healthy at all.

Did I actually use the words “*vowed* *never to smoke it again*”? I suspect that the following report, circa 2016, could fall under the heading ""*he never learns*"".

**REPORT #2**

Last week I was in Vietnam, and as I tend to whenever I am in a far flung country, I checked out the local (legal) psychoactive scene.

In this case, I found very little. Occasionally, however, I did notice small groups of men in the streets smoking something from huge bamboo pipes. I presumed this to be tobacco, although I hoped it was something else.

Naturally I couldn't resist, so I approached a couple of chaps, who looked friendly enough, and offered a few local shekels for a toke.

They refused the money but proffered the pipe freely. In fact, they urged me to sit down, an offer which I accepted.

Taking a large hit I immediately realized why.

[ I took a huge hit. What could possibly go wrong? ](https://preview.redd.it/ks6qnwncnpoc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbc3fad7b24aedd55a593cd0220b8263d0d47fec)

I was hit for six. I was dizzy, I thought I was fainting, and I felt nausea coming-on. It wasn’t nice. It felt very much like a re-run of my earlier nicotiana rustica ordeal.

I didn't slump into a heap this time, but I was close.

After a few minutes, and many deep breaths, I started to slowly get my head together, and I took a photograph of the packet.

[ Thuoc Lao. Never again. ](https://preview.redd.it/3nqjyp3hnpoc1.jpg?width=4459&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8434df6e4ff2488e60b94a6b6a8116d1be1a8d2b)

On returning to the hotel, later in the evening, I asked the concierge if they could translate the front of this and explain what it was. Yes, it was indeed nicotiana rustica, which also bore the words *Aztec tobacco* and w*ild tobacco*. I also discovered that its more formal name there was *thuoc lao*.

-

What did I deduce from this second slap in the face?

1. Perhaps this feeling is normal, and people get off on it. God knows how. By seating me the locals obviously knew what was coming.
2. I had consumed about 3 bottles of beer: the experience sobered me up instantly, and I remained so for the rest of the evening. Indeed, I didn't feel like engaging any further intoxicant of any type, and didn't drink for the rest of the night. After about half an hour, I felt half-decent and strangely clear-headed. In fact, I felt quite good. Perhaps this phase is the attraction.
3. Like the first time, it felt rather toxic and unhealthy. It's hard to see how anyone could get used to this, but they do appear to. I have no idea what it does to the health of habitual users, but it certainly can't be good news.

Despite the flip side, I'm glad that I re-sampled, largely to have experienced it in a more authentic setting than my room. However, I don't see any scenario at all in which I will repeat it again. This time I mean it.

**ADDITIONAL SAFETY NOTE**

"orally consuming meth
non-recreationally","Hello,
I've been diagnosed with ADHD. I've been prescribed Adderall and take it occasionally but the positive effects haven't been amazing, regardless of dose (prescribed 10 mg, but have taken 20 and 30 a few times as well). My distractibility has gone down but my motivation and general executive dysfunction has not improved meaningfully. Instead of cycling through mobile games for 2 hours instead of doing homework, I'll lay in bed staring at the ceiling for 2 hours. I feel as impotent and demotivated as ever. To date, I've experienced **no physical or mental euphoria** whatsoever from any of the doses I've taken, and have felt moderate physical discomfort at 30 mg.


A couple of weeks ago, I was sold MDMA that ended up containing meth. I don't know the amount as I didn't test and flushed the bag after realizing it was laced. I felt some degree of physical and mental euphoria, but it was relatively mild, on par with euphoria I've felt from getting moderately drunk while in a good mood. I didn't feel overly energized, but I'd also thrown up at the time of the trip for unrelated reasons so it's possible that I'd feel more energized if I were in a rested/healthy physical state. 

The main reason that I'm considering taking meth again is that for the duration of the high, I felt more motivated than I had in at least a year. I didn't end up trying to accomplish anything of note due to spending most of the trip trying to come down from the high and ground myself (as mentioned before, I did not intend to take meth), but all of the problems I'd been struggling with at the time, some for weeks or more, felt achievable and it felt easy to put a plan into motion to solve them (something I have a crippling inability to do a lot of the time). I've lost faith in more standard psychiatric medication being helpful with the issue of the executive dysfunction and motivation, and am willing to take a risk with this. That said, if I am to, I want it to be as safely and with the least chance of it spiraling out of control as possible.

**THE PLAN**
I plan on getting a bunch of those packs of cheap plastic 20oz water bottles and dissolving a small amount of meth in each one. Right now I'm considering 5mg, but can adjust this dose based on feedback. From there, the idea would be to drink a bottle like one would a coffee, first thing in the morning, and going about my day. Does anybody have any suggestions or concerns in relation to my approach? The biggest thing I'm scared of at this point in time is mismanagement turning into meth abuse/addiction.

Thank you in advance!

Edit: I should have mentioned this earlier but was reminded to when somebody mentioned getting treatment for depression, but I've tried Wellbutrin, SSRIS, Lamictal, Lithium, Abilify, Seroquel, Strattera, Guanfacine, and possibly another atypical antidepressant that I'm forgetting the name of.

Dissolution and Evaporation for Homogenization," I'm gonna be sending off some samples for testing soon. The lab I'm  accessing uses FTIR spectrometry and immunoassay test strips. They  require only 5mg samples, and thinking of the chocolate chip cookie  analogy of fentanyl contamination I'm hoping to minimize the possibility  that the sample I send them is unrepresentative of the whole batch's  overall composition. I'm thinking that dissolving powder into water then  letting it evaporate until only solids remain would result in  homogeneous solids with equal distribution of all constituent chemicals.  Is this theoretically sound? Are there practical considerations to take  into account? Any other insights or suggestions gleaned from study or  experience?

Story about people who've saved others from overdoses,"A few weeks ago, I met a woman who said she's used Narcan more than 2,200 times to save people from fatal overdoses in Kensington, a neighborhood in Philadelphia. I'm a reporter, so I found her fascinating not just as a person but as someone who's done a lot of reporting on addiction, harm reduction and recovery. Here's a link to my story, which profiles not only Roz Pichardo of Philadelphia's Operation Save Our City, but others working in Boston, Washington DC and San Francisco.

Me and him (18M at the time) were pregaming for a concert with a bottle of vodka. After a couple drinks he pulled out a sheet of purple pills and popped two, then bragged about having taken 6 before we met up. Having no idea about the possible harm of the mix at the time, I didn't really question it. I was aware that he was taking them recreationally and in huge amounts. Two years afterwards he turned into a fullblown junkie and i found out that he was high on benzos for a couple years now.
Anyway, fast forward to the concert, he just stood there in the crowd, his half-open eyes twitching. I'm not sure that he was aware of his surroundings. Knowing what I know now, I can't believe that he survived the combination.",15,16,2024-03-01 13:32:00,likelihood surviving 8mg xanax ~250ml vodka question probably sounds stupid know n't intend friend 'm honestly disbelief survived 18m time pregaming concert bottle vodka couple drinks pulled sheet purple pills popped two bragged taken 6 met idea possible harm mix time n't really question aware taking recreationally huge amounts two years afterwards turned fullblown junkie found high benzos couple years anyway fast forward concert stood crowd half-open eyes twitching 'm sure aware surroundings knowing know ca n't believe survived combination
When should you use Narcan on a stranger?,"I was at a concert tonight where there was an unknown medical emergency. People from the back started yelling ""medic, call 911"" and someone from the other side of the room started yelling for Narcan. 

The thing is, the person yelling about Narcan wasn't near the person and had no idea what the medical emergency was. It did make me think to start carrying Narcan, but at the same time, I don't know if I would have felt comfortable just running over and dosing the person just because they collapsed. I'm not sure how the situation resolved, but after a few minutes people started giving thumbs up and the show went on, I'm assuming the person woke up and was ok.

So, if a non-drug user like me decides to carry Narcan to a concert, what is the etiquette for using it on a stranger or involving myself in a situation? Would I only use it if their friends say ""yes, this person is on drugs"" or would you just give it to them because better safe than sorry?",30,29,2024-02-28 09:01:54,use narcan stranger concert tonight unknown medical emergency people back started yelling `` medic call 911 '' someone side room started yelling narcan thing person yelling narcan n't near person idea medical emergency make think start carrying narcan time n't know would felt comfortable running dosing person collapsed 'm sure situation resolved minutes people started giving thumbs show went 'm assuming person woke ok. non-drug user like decides carry narcan concert etiquette using stranger involving situation would use friends say `` yes person drugs '' would give better safe sorry

Death Is The Consequence of The [Harm Reduction] Void: A Present From the Darknet,"*How do you furnish individuals with potentially life-saving information on their drug of choice when the government is waging a brutal unrelenting war against all parties?*

\--

This is a project which should be undertaken by governments, not by individual citizens. It is a project which any society that presents itself as reasonable and indeed, civilized, should be driving. It is a project which the state should be managing, as a core part of a comprehensive health and safety service.

With respect to the latter, it is self-evident that free-of-charge provision of drug safety information to consumers saves lives. Unfortunately, when governments view those same consumers as criminals, as *the enemy*, to be defeated and crushed in a relentless war of attrition, the result is inevitable: a void of vital information.

Where there should be risk mitigation data there is propaganda. Where there should be education there is misinformation. Where there should be safety advice there is censorship. Death is the consequence.

**FILLING THE VOID: CHRONOLOGY**

*The Drug Users Bible Project*, an effort to fill this void, is now 16 years old. So where are we? This is a recap via a chronology of events:

>· **2008-2017**: I self-administered 182 different drugs, documented each experience and wrote the 638-page harm reduction book, *The Drug Users Bible.*  
>  
>In the words of the publisher: “*For each he recorded the life-sensitive safety data, including the anticipated onset times, the common threshold doses, the routes of administration, and the expected duration of the experience. In addition, for every compound he also produced a trip report, detailing the qualitative experience itself.*”  
>  
>· **2017-2022**: Over its three editions the book became an Amazon best seller and widely known within the community.  
>  
>· **2022-2023**: In an attempt to reach those consumers who didn’t read books, or who couldn’t afford them, I produced a PDF version for free-distribution. The first weekend alone yielded almost 20,000 downloads.  
>  
>· **2023-2024**: Imagine vital harm reduction information being provided without charge at point of drug purchase, on a global basis. Imagine the potential impact this might have in terms of user safety.  
>  
>With this vision in mind I approached the darknet social media platform (*Dread*). With the enthusiastic support I received, I then began to approach all the major darknet drug markets, asking for help in turning this far fetched scenario into a reality.  
>  
>· **2024**: The PDF is now provided free-of-charge by Dread itself, by darknet directories, and by almost every significant drug market.

These events are documented in more detail here: [https://dmtrott.substack.com/p/drugs-the-darknet-and-the-media-my](https://dmtrott.substack.com/p/drugs-the-darknet-and-the-media-my)

**WHERE TO NEXT?**

What about the addition of an easily navigable and portable website of the entire book? This would carry the advantage that consumers who use a browser could be hyper-linked directly to their drug of choice when in need of information. Further, it could, perhaps, be written such that anyone could pick it up and freely add it to a third party website.

However, there was a snag. My technical capability ends at flat html and ancient web hosting. I would need help. I was stuck.

Fortunately, help was to come from a familiar source. Out of the blue this possibility was independently suggested by a Dread moderator. It was then discussed with an administrator, and a team was established for what would surely be a tricky conversion project: tricky because I wrote the book in MS-Word 2007, without using macros or any other tool to standardize the file. It was written page by page specifically for paperback printing.

Luckily, not only were the assembled crew (*Thotbot*, *Syntactic\_Raven*, *Shakybeats* and *Paris*) extremely proficient, they were also hard working and dedicated to the cause of harm reduction: the cause of saving lives. The end product exceeds all my expectations and can be browsed directly via the following link: [https://DrugUsersBible.org](https://DrugUsersBible.org)

**WE, THE PEOPLE**

In the first instance please visit the website. Hopefully you will find the presentation to be aesthetic, the navigation intuitive, and the content easy to share. The latter is particularly important.

Let’s recall the context here:

>*“People are dying because of ignorance.*  
>  
>*They are dying because unremitting propaganda is denying them vital safety information.*  
>  
>*They are dying because legislators and the media are censoring the science, and are ruthlessly pushing an ideological agenda instead.*  
>  
>*They are dying because the first casualty of war is truth, and the war on drugs is no different.”*

The good news is that despite this wilful negligence and ongoing assault on the 250 million people who choose to use drugs we can still help each other. We can all play a role in getting essential safety material into the hands of those who need it the most. With this in mind, please share the website link, and indeed, links to specific content as appropriate. In particular, if you are a webmaster, host a copy on your own website (just contact me for a zip).

If governments won’t act (and they won’t), and if the UN won’t act (and it won’t, because I asked), we will have to do it ourselves. Whatever our personal drug of choice, and whatever our choices are, we can surely act as a community, as the people.

Let’s be the helping hand. Let’s make harm reduction awareness ubiquitous within our culture.

Prescription Medicines Can Bite Too [Pregabalin],"*For some recreational drug consumers the fact that a compound is medically prescribed infers a rubber stamp in terms of safety. My experience with pregabalin proves this to be sheer folly.* 

I should have known better. I should have resisted complacency. I should have followed my own process and procedures. I didn’t, and I probably got what I deserved.

The following excerpt from *The Drug Users Bible* details my sorry story. 

[Pregabalin](https://preview.redd.it/tgyili318ric1.jpg?width=4188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e3e15a14c0b0ade6dbd31af14328661c5a8cccd)

**SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE: PREGABALIN**

First synthesized in 1990, pregabalin appeared on the market as a prescription drug under the brand name *lyrica* in 2005. It is used to treat a variety of ailments, including anxiety and pain.

Descriptions of its psychoactive effects vary somewhat. Whilst it is commonly classified as an anxiolytic, a sedative and a relaxant, I have sometimes seen references to hypnotic properties, and occasionally I have encountered suggestions that it can induce euphoria. Despite the US government currently regarding it as having a low potential for abuse (Schedule V), it is clear that this is a serious recreational drug.

Regarding dosage, my initial inclination was to go for 450mg, but I subsequently found too many forum posts stating that sub-300mg doses were more than sufficient. \[e.g. “*150mg gives me a nice little high while 300mg gets me crazy high*” \~Silenced, Bluelight.org\]. I found these hard to ignore.

Given that pregabalin was developed as a successor to gabapentin my expectations today are not great. I tested the latter a few weeks ago, and found it to be generally relaxing and calming but without anything in the way of uplift. I am also feeling a little washed-out and tired, which won't help matters.

>  
>T+2:00 At this point I am heavily inebriated and groggy. The dreamy headspace now carries a hint of nausea and some dizziness, to the extent that I lie on my bed for 15 minutes. This is rapidly becoming very uncomfortable and is definitely not pleasant. I soon hit the bed for a second time.  
>  
>T+ 4:30 The second recovery nap turned into a deep two hour sleep. I awoke feeling horrible: dizzy, groggy, and unable to function properly. I staggered to the bathroom, and then downstairs, trying to avoid contact with anyone.   
>  
>I place my head on my arms, lean forward and rest on the desk. I occasionally manage to lift myself up and struggle to type some words. Incredibly I am barely able to function. This is an awful experience and I wonder how much longer it will last. My fingers are trembling and I feel dreadful.

>T+5:30 Somehow I have just about managed to eat a pizza, which I ate almost mechanically to avoid making too much of a mess. This was a real challenge, but I got through it courtesy of the motivating thought that a bit of food might bring the unwanted-high down faster.

>T+6:00 I finally feel slightly less out of it, and I can just about type these notes without recovery breaks. It is far from easy, but I am able to sit up in my chair again without hunching forwards. Gradually I am integrating back into the normality around me.   
>  
>T+7:00 I am very much coming down; thank goodness. The dizzy inebriation can now be forced into the background with relative ease. I am quite stable again as I walk around, although I still feel generally woozy and not fully tuned back in to my surroundings, which have an unreal edge to them.  
>  
>T+7:30 I note that time seems to have passed rather quickly. This has been an extremely long ride in terms of the continued psychoactivity of this drug, but it doesn’t seem like it. It has now evolved into a mild queasiness about the head and some disorientation, both physical and mental.  
>  
>Throughout this, anxieties and worries have been generally absent. I might add though that there was a degree of anxiety at the peak in terms of the experience itself: this was worry about when I would recover and if I was actually okay. Yes, it was that intense.  
>  
>The inebriated headiness is now mild but is constantly present, and at times it can still be sickly and nauseous. I believe that I could now pass as sober again in a complex social situation, but I would have to concentrate to do so.  
>  
>T+8:00 The intensity continues to wind down, albeit very slowly. I am astonished that it hit so hard and I feel a significant degree of relief.  
>  
>T+8:30 At 10:30pm I am closing in on my usual bedtime. I expect a difficult night’s sleep, not on the basis of the current effects of the drug, but because I slept for over two hours from 4pm. 

Despite several wake-ups with a dry mouth, the night’s sleep wasn’t too bad. The next morning, however, I was still not fully with it and although I wasn’t ill, I was not particularly well. I felt like I had a hangover but without the headache, and I was occasionally slightly dizzy and a tad nauseous. A sea-sickness-like feeling lingered for most of the day. 

This one was a shock. I clearly took far too much and paid a price in terms of a strong intoxication which at times was extremely uncomfortable. I found myself struggling for some hours, hoping that the ride would wind down and end. Clearly a dose of 300mg or less would have been more than adequate.

Although this was a bad experience, it was an instructive one, from which the lessons are self-evident. If you use this drug be very careful with the dose, and of course don’t make a habit of it. It can bite, and not in a pleasant way.

**PREGABALIN ADDENDUM**

Subsequent to this experience I took the trouble to further investigate the track record of this drug. What I found was alarming. Despite having only appeared relatively recently, the rate of fatality associated with its use was on a steep upward trajectory.

The following graph illustrates the number of cases in which pregabalin was mentioned on death certificates in England & Wales for the period to the end of 2017:

The message could hardly be more obvious, and it re-enforces my words above. This is a serious drug and should not be underestimated.

Trying to help a friend.,"Hello, so, i have a friend that has been abusing over the counter flu medication for years ( one box a day ) because of the codein that is in it. She is not ready to stop yet (even though it is something she said she will try to do during this year). The pills are made of 210mg paracetamol, 250 propifenazone, 10mg codeinphosfate hemidrate and 25mg of caffeine. I was thinking, purely in a harm reduction philosophy that would maybe be better for her to extract the codeine so she doesn't harm the liver even more because of the paracetamol and everything. What do you think? Please whoever knows more about this let me know, i am really worried about her and i am the only one she openly speaks about her addiction and i know she will consider my advice if i told her.

so my question is, why haven't hard reduction policies been more widely implemented? 

clearly the fact that almost 3x more people have died last year then in 2016 is because we haven't implemented harm reduction policies every where right? or am i missing something?

musical hallucination during MDMA/amphetamine comedown - should I be concerned?,"hey everyone, i just wanted to ask about a strange experience i've been having a few times on the comedown of MDMA and now speed. 

I'll be in a quiet place as I come down at night or during the morning after, and I will hallucinate music coming from normal noise sources like fans, radiators, etc. It's hard for me to explain, I can hear the sounds from a fan and know that its only a fan, but i can sense music through it, like my brain is filling the gaps with melodies and percussions. If I get closer to the noise source it is i think a bit more present, but it feels very vague spatially. I can hear it but it doesn't sound or feel like it would coming from a speaker. 

The first time it happened I heard beats and singing through the toilet pipes and I thought maybe the neighbours were playing music but it didn't sound like that, and it was 3 in the morning. Today it came from the radiator next to the bed, and I knew it was in my head. I googled ""musical hallucination"" and saw that it was a real thing, but it was very hard to find information regarding it and stimulants. 

I smiled when I heard the music but also got a bit worried and had to step away and do something else, I'm just wondering if this is a precursor to more serious psychosis-like hallucinations. I don't know if I should be concerned and any thoughts would be appreciated :) 

I've not had this from other drugs and I mostly do weed and ketamine and sometimes psilocybin.

The Terrifying Derangement of Salvia Divinorum,"*It can be nightmarish and traumatic, with no anchor to reality whatsoever. Yet just a few years ago it was a hugely popular YouTube craze, particularly amongst the young.* 

https://preview.redd.it/gkikjdomgdhc1.jpg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01885275a969c772cd19f413a39e3cc934b11b3d

As a shamanic or traditional herb taken in an authentic setting, I am sure that *salvia* produces a manageable and instructive experience. However, in the form it is generally consumed in the West, the outcome is anything but. 

This was one of my earliest experiments, and it was terrifying. It wasn’t helped by the fact that I had no idea what was coming. 

My sorry story, as extracted from *The Drug Users Bible*, is presented below. If you are thinking about indulging, you might want to think again, and give this one a miss. 

.

# SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE: SALVIA DIVINORUM

My experiences with salvia divinorum bore little resemblance to those of the shamans, as reported in literature. This is surely due to the fact that they chewed, whilst I smoked. Indeed, I smoked *extracts* on each of my three trips, rather than the raw plant itself, and these were of the order of 50x. 

https://preview.redd.it/eli7k4vngdhc1.jpg?width=5312&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45ac5c29ba7db7dd2558e79a98ef8671ac5223ca

These forays were not pleasant. Each time I was overwhelmed, largely by fear. This was despite the fact that on the last two occasions I thought I had it nailed. 

The first trip took me completely by surprise: I do mean completely, given that I thought I had purchased some sort of cannabinoid. For the second I was better prepared: I lay on a bed in the dark to contemplate. For the third, I had a sitter. Regardless of circumstance, however, I felt myself leaving my bodily existence and hanging on, or trying to hang on, in abject terror. 

Colour became bright, edges became extremely sharp, and everything seemed to be morphing in a terrifying manner, stacking into an infinity of two dimensional layers. None of this was helped by the fact that I was inexperienced: these were amongst my earliest expeditions into the deliriant /psychedelic world.

During each trip I had the curious notion that I was in a realm from which I could see different timelines unfolding and inviting in front of me. Also, that there was some form of intelligence there, which was aloof, and which was not necessarily benign. Indeed, the undertones were sinister.

I felt at the time that I got nothing out of these, at least in a positive sense. I now realise that the long-term value of the insights and perspectives I gained from them was in fact significant, even if the experiences themselves were traumatic (see *the train* metaphor described in Section 2.2).

The three trips were recorded as follows:

>TRIP #1  
>  
>I took a single hit of my apparent cannabinoid in the garden, from my small portable bong. I then walked slowly through the kitchen towards my office, when it struck me: suddenly.   
>  
>Rather than a mellowing and glowing relaxation, there was sharpness to edges, and there was a transposed repetition of objects like they were stacked behind each other multiple times. There was the immediate understanding that I was gripped by something and it wasn’t a cannabinoid!   
>  
>Yes, I was terrified, as I stumbled into the office. Sinking to my hands and knees I crawled, and somehow pulled myself up into my chair.   
>  
>Everything on the computer screen presented the same stacked manifestation, with each window being repeated behind itself into the distance. I hit the keyboard in panic, obviously to no effect.  
>  
>How long would this last? Had I permanently damaged myself? Had I really done it this time?   
>  
>I was overcome by the fear that I might never return to normality.   
>  
>Eventually, I did start to return, to my enormous gratitude and relief. I managed to walk back into the kitchen. As I stood I felt something very strange. I felt connected to others, not through memory but through some strange sense; a sense that was in fact focused through a lens of compassion.   
>  
>This passed quickly, and could have been related to the overwhelming sense of relief that I was still feeling, but I distinctly recall it to this day.  
>  
>Of course, as soon as I was able, I researched *salvia divinorum* via the Internet, and the cause of this apparent derangement became clear.  
>  
>TRIP #2  
>  
>On the second occasion I planned the experience carefully, and I thought I was ready. I drew the curtains in my bedroom and lay on the bed. I was fearful of walking and hurting myself so I blocked the door.   
>  
>Unfortunately, the preparation and anticipation did not mitigate the shock. It was still harrowing. The same sliced manifestation of reality occurred, with the same infinity of 2D layers morphing before me.   
>  
>I sensed some other entity, possibly hostile, and had to suppress the urge to negotiate and plead for my safe return.   
>  
>The experience was again other-worldly. I felt as though I was being sucked out of this reality, into some other. Perhaps this is why some of the people in those YouTube trip videos appear to pull against some invisible non-existent force.   
>  
>This feeling induced panic. I didn’t want to go, and I sensed that the anomalous presence was not benevolent. I swore myself to be a force for good, as I felt like I was bargaining for my life.   
>  
>Fearing that I was leaving this realm for ever, I thought about my family, and all that I valued. I felt a primal need to fight to stay: I got off the bed and pushed my way out of the door.  
>  
>As I lurched onto the landing, I thought momentarily that I was recovering, but I wasn’t.   
>  
>I found myself looking up the stairs to the third floor, and again, the notion occurred that I was looking at alternative timelines, or parallel worlds. The thought that I might return to the wrong one suddenly struck me, as my usual surroundings felt so alien and unfamiliar. In some of those worlds, it seemed that the house even had the wrong number of floors.   
>  
>Things still didn’t seem to be right as I shuffled down the stairs, but I was slowly emerging and returning to normality. When I came round sufficiently, I called family and friends, just to connect and to make sure that all was well and that I had found my way back into the correct slice of the continuum.  
>  
>TRIP #3  
>  
>This was a chicken trip; meaning that I barely inhaled. I did, however, smoke enough to skirt around the experience and semi immerse.   
>  
>The same feelings were prevalent, but having someone present gave me a firmer anchor of this reality. I was still scared, very scared, as I stared into the threatening space which enveloped me, and I recall that again I tried to open dialogue, through panic.   
>  
>As this slowly wore off I swore that I wouldn’t put myself through it again. 

Despite all this, if I ever find the opportunity to engage this interesting plant through its traditional and shamanic oral route, I will probably take it. Otherwise: no chance.

**AN ANECDOTAL TALE (THE BLAST)**

As I approached the counter in the head shop, a young man, perhaps 20 years of age, was stood directly in front of me, dithering. He pointed at a colourful packet which sat on the display, and mumbled words to the effect that he and his friends wanted to “*have* *a blast*”. 

The sales attendant couldn’t help or advise, and would only respond to his questions with the legally prescribed mantra: “*It’s not for human consumption”*. 

I then noticed that our young test pilot was pointing at a sachet of salvia divinorum (60x extract).

This rang alarm bells: his mates were clearly hiding around the corner outside, and they were likely to smoke this stuff somewhere in the street, with no idea at all of the effect they would be inducing. 

Salvia wouldn’t give them a *blast*; it would detonate the unexpected trauma of an out-of-body experience, potentially in a packed street, potentially on a busy road. I felt compelled to intervene.

I tried to explain, but the guy had clearly been drinking alcohol. 

What to do? 

I looked for the safest bet on offer on the presentation stand, and referred him to a well known stimulant. I explained that this was a terrible idea (given his alcohol consumption), but that snorting a stim would on balance be more likely to give him a good time, and less likely to lead to a nasty accident in the middle of the city. 

He bought my logic, and purchased.

The assistant then smiled at me and said “*Well done. Are you his dad or just a good Samaritan?*”

Then it took a turn for the worse. 

The kid returned, and asked for the salvia instead. It appeared that the scare story had appealed to his foolhardy mates. So off he went, armed with his *blast*, to take him directly to la-la land. 

I am pretty certain that one toke on the salvia joint (which is how they planned to smoke it) will have demonstrated that my every word had been correct. I sincerely hope that their lesson was learned in a park or somewhere quiet, rather than in a place of potentially fatal danger.

Should I be worried about my nose?,"So in quick context I snorted crystal mdma and crushed up mdma pills on a random weekend with some friends and didn’t notice anything wrong with my nose apart from the some of it stuck in my nose and I washed it off and then the day after I snorted crushed mdma pills again (which I knew was stupid)  but I was wondering why it wasn’t hitting the second time and I thought it must’ve of been my tolerance so I checked the mirror and I realised that the powder was stuck and looked like it was stored in my nose (septum) so I picked it off and then it left a dent sort of (how you would imagine a scab to look like after picking it off) and then it scared me and checked my other nose hole and it was less severe but still had redness and I think it may have bled. This is my first time ever snorting anything and I don’t know whether I should wait for it to heal as it’s been 2 days after this event or to get in contact with my doctor.

Looking for non-residental Managed Alcohol Programs,"Hello, 

I'm interested in non-residental Managed Alcohol Programs. I found many MAPs that operate as part of a wider residental program or a homeless shelter. I started with this [scoping review](https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-022-00646-0).

From there, I identified three MAPs that are non-residental:

* [Vancouver, Canada](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687637.2020.1764500)
* [Sudbury, Canada](https://www.uvic.ca/research/centres/cisur/assets/docs/map-sudbury-report-exec-summary.pdf)
* somewhere in [Switzerland](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28104548/)

These are all from the scoping review. I tried searching some more, but I found no other non-residential MAPs anywhere. Surely there have to be some more around!  


I'm turning to the community with this - do you know about any other such program?

Certain Psychoactives Are Best Left Alone: Datura Is One Of Them,"*Scratch the surface of any social media platform and you will find the curious and the foolhardy, often kids, seeking to dabble with deliriants like datura. They are about to make a serious mistake.*

Sometimes they have been misled by a friend, or by a post on social media (or another corner of the Internet). Sometimes they have been sold a myth by irresponsible media reporting, which too often describes the experience as a high or a trip. It's nothing of the sort.

Datura is for use by experienced shamans, and is absolutely not suitable for a recreational sojourn. It is one to avoid. My own story, as extracted from *The Drug Users Bible,* perhaps illustrates how even the most tentative of experiments can enter precarious of territory.

[Datura Seeds](https://preview.redd.it/dcwxs4m9ezfc1.jpg?width=3897&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=389ca531ebf8670ef9beee7d2ce0a7a67c2dd7ae)

# SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE: DATURA

I wasn’t going to include datura in this book, and I didn’t include it the first edition. Having experienced delirium at the hands of nutmeg, I saw no sense whatsoever in exposing myself to it again, risking my life and my mental health in the process.

Why have I changed my mind? I would argue that I haven’t. What I have decided to do is to go through the normal routine (research, document and record), but critically, using a minimal dose.

The idea is to more fully elaborate upon the dangers of this plant, and on deliriants in general, whilst limiting the threat of self-harm as far as I can. This is, after all, a book about drug safety, and on balance, given that most readers will already have heard of it, I feel that it would be remiss not to include datura in some form.

At the outset, I think it is worth stressing again what delirium actually is. A contributor to the *DMT-Nexus* forum described it in these terms:

“*When a patient gets hallucinations from Datura alkaloids (hyoscyamine, atropine, or scopolamine), it is a medical sign of a near fatal dose*.” \~ 69ron

On this basis, to experience delirium or hallucinations with this it is necessary to overdose, with risk of death. Hardly surprisingly, therefore, on sensible social media platforms the advice of experienced people is unambiguous in stating that datura should be avoided. This is usually expressed in stark and graphic terms.

Even Wikipedia joins the chorus:

“*Most parts of the plants are toxic, and datura has a long history of use for causing delirious states and death*.”

Medical papers are awash with details of the adverse effects, which can include seizures, hyperthermia, wide-complex dysrhythmias, cardiovascular collapse, failure of organ systems, rhabdomyolysis, and liver, kidney and brain damage. I hope that you are painting a picture from this.

For my own cautious experiment the question of dosage is obviously of paramount importance. However, it quickly emerges that dose measurement is far from a straight forward exercise. Online comments like these are not uncommon:

“*There is no way to guess a reasonable dose, because potency of the plant material itself and appropriate dose for an individual appear to vary so much*.” \~ Erowid

“*A good dosage advise on Datura is not possible, as the alkaloid content varies so extreme. The seeds are recognised as the part of the plant with the least variation, but they can have anywhere from 0.1 to 0.7% tropane alkaloids*.” \~ Ginkgo, DMT-Nexus.

On the premise of the latter comment, one seed could have seven times the potency of the next seed. This is a huge disparity, and it doesn't help to answer the fundamental question with respect to my own dose, which is: how much am I prepared to poison myself for the purpose of this experiment? The answer to this is as little as I can get away with whilst reaching a sufficient threshold to write about it in a credible way.

In view of the potential horror, and given the enormous dose variability, I decide to take a single seed. On this dose, of course, I don’t anticipate delirium. However, some form of dream potentiation during sleep is perhaps a possibility.

Regarding duration, a moderate dose is generally considered to last around 8-12 hours, with higher doses persisting for perhaps 2-3 days. Effects can apparently be felt after an hour, give or take half an hour, with peak typically being reached at around 4 to 6 hours.

Ready to proceed, I select a *datura stramonium* seed from the small plastic baggy: one which looks relatively wholesome and alive. Aware of the potential for impaired judgement and lost memory under its influence, I dispose of the rest.

[ A Single Seed: Wholesome & Alive ](https://preview.redd.it/w8djzu9dezfc1.jpg?width=1620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=841a049b3714795f1780a7fc525206d9a9da5952)

As I prepare to take the plunge, I cannot deny that part of me is hoping that the exercise fails, and that my supply is somehow deficient. Yes, my nutmeg experience really was that terrifying.

>T+0:00 I briefly chew the seed, breaking it with my teeth, and I swallow the debris with a glass of water. I have started the experiment at 5:00pm so that any effects will over-run into my sleeping hours.  
>  
>T+0:45 Unexpectedly, I do feel a little something. Placebo effects can be convincing, but there does seem to be a heady strangeness present. This is not debilitating in any way, but it manifests largely through a tendency to linger on thought-patterns. I am in a calm but slightly off-key space, aware of distinct sounds and sights, but fully rational. This apparent psychoactivity could of course have been initiated via buccal absorption whilst I chewed, in which case I would expect it to dissipate relatively quickly.  
>  
>T+2:00 The mild psychoactivity has stabilised, or perhaps I have come to terms with it. It is there in the background, but is not really intrusive, in that I could probably forget it if I was heavily engaged in an absorbing task. As it is not unpleasant I would in fact like it to persist, at least for a while longer.  
>  
>T+3:00 I feel quite close to base, but with a touch of headiness enduring. I have had a bite to eat and will now embark upon some light exercise.  
>  
>T+4:00 “*The swim passed as standard. I find myself maybe a little more self-reflective than usual and possibly more neutral in mood. Apart from this I now feel normal. The self-reflection is interesting in that, given that this was induced via a single seed, it aligns with the idea that consuming many seeds would result in total withdrawal from the outside world*.”  
>  
>I scribbled the above paragraph on a scrap of paper at the pool, but on the way home I noticed a mild feeling of disconnection with the visible world around me, but inclusive of greater visual acuity.  
>  
>I again sensed a more distinct separation of the senses. If normal sensory inputs lock together to create the 3D construct which is experienced as reality, this locking process didn’t seem to be fully occurring. I was aware that I was processing sight, sound, touch, smell and taste separately: that there was a lag in melding them all together. This was a little disturbing, not least because I instinctively felt that had I taken more seeds the lock would have occurred in a disjointed manner, creating, ultimately, delirium and a scenescape which did not reflect actuality.  
>  
>T+5:00 I am now tiring and ready to retire. I retain that slightly strange heady feel, without uplift, but it is now tinged with fatigue. I head to bed hoping for easy sleep and pleasant dreams.

The night’s sleep was not what I expected, bearing in mind that I had ONE seed. It delivered fairly vivid dreams, which were a little stronger than usual and perhaps more weird, but not crazily so. However, on each wake-up, about four of them, I was so dry-mouthed that I needed water. I also needed to urinate, although not through volume (the need was simply there).

During the course of the night the headspace of the evening before also turned heavier, and in the morning I had a headache. I won’t over-egg this: it wasn’t particularly painful but it was there, I was aware of it, and to some degree it lingered for some hours. Initially there was also a minor background buzz and a slight aura of strangeness.

The message was crystal clear. The experiences I outlined earlier were solidly psychoactive and one seed isn’t the joke of a dose I thought it was. Thank goodness I only had the one. The potential for negative payload was obvious even at this level.

If you want some anecdotes to convince you further, read ‘*Datura 'Train Wrecks'’* on Erowid. Often, delirious people do not know what they are doing: they are out of control whilst their body is fighting the poison. If the datura doesn’t kill them, their real-world situation may well do so instead. Trying to run through a wall or through a window to escape the demons, digging out the burrowing ants from your flesh with a sharp knife, cutting off your penis with shears because you are demented; anything is possible in this terrain. This is what delirium is: you lose the plot and you lose rationality, and not in a nice way.

Whilst datura can be used as an admixture by experienced shamans, it is absolutely not a recreational drug. If you want to trip, or to hallucinate, use a tried and tested psychedelic.

Finally, let’s be clear: I skimmed the surface here. To some degree I have just gone through the motions, but by doing so hopefully the message is obvious. Don’t let curiosity kill you. Trust me on this: it’s just not worth it.

**SOME RESPONSES TO MY SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS ON DATURA**

Alexander Sammy: “*Datura will break you, question is that what you looking for?* *be careful for what you wish. If you don't find the way you will be lost forever. 2 guys I know went mentally lost.*

Tim Burn: “*I freaked out for 3 days.. Didn't think I would ever come right again.. Very vivid hallucinations.. Very dangerous*.”

Anthony Stanton: “*I remember reading one story in a psychedelic book where this young guy took datura but nothing happened so he went to bed, woke up in hospital not knowing/remembering how he got there or what happened and realised his tongue and penis was missing (cut off)* ”

David Scott: “*I know someone who was sent to the mental hospital after eating those seeds*.”

Chad Powell: “*Don’t do it! Very dangerous! I did it in high school. Woke up in a jail cell. The trip basically makes you see and talk people who aren’t there, lots of faces that form out of the sky, ground, on my hands. You loose complete control. Be very careful, it can not only poison you but can get you killed*.”

Rasheed Fsu Leonard: “*Datura is hell...*”

Isaac Ray: “*Watched a dude accidentally drink enough tea for 5 people. A couple hours later he was naked, violent and screaming incomprehensibly. He had to be held down by several people who all had to wash human waste of various kinds off of them afterwards. It was not pretty*.”

Aleksandar Ćulibrk: “*Know a couple of people that did this shit.. Talking to dead people, seeing objects on fire that aren't, feeling poisoned, a lot of general ""sounds like fun"" trips but in reality not at all and with a lot of repercussions.*

*None of them live a normal life anymore, a LOT of mental health problems, big warning to anyone thinking of trying it... Just don't!*”

Michael Wayne Medlin: “*I did it one time and ended up wrecking my car into a tree going 40 mph. I had no intention on driving at all. This shit will confuse you to the point where you don't even know where you are or what's going on. It's incredibly scary and yes, you see people and things that are not there, you talk gibberish and you think it means something. Much like being stuck in a nightmare*.”

Jillsa Goodwitch: ""*In an era with so many options to biohack and experience ecstasy and wonder and freedom, unfortunately people are going to take the skeeviest way to that path unfortunately and Darwin will claim his quota*.""

Elijah James Crawley: ""*I have a mate who decided to brew a tea using the flowers, no measurements on dosage. Suffered partial loss of sight for 24hrs, a disjointed sense of reality, tripped for 3 days, damage to the nervous system, ongoing mild psychosis*.""

Ports or PICC for IV harm reduction?,"So, through the years... I've met some crazy IV users. Many long term users, end up with some serious problems with circulation, develop wounds, deep vein thrombosis, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, stroke, amputation, endocarditis, etcetera, etcetera. 

I've seen people so strung out on shit, and so desperate to ""hit"" that they do stuff that occasionally haunts my dreams. Some memorable moments... I've seen a beautiful girl hanging upside-down (topless) with a purple head - and her ""friend"" (on crack) continuously stabbing at this girl's jugular. So high on crack, that she's shaking... and literally STABBING this other girl's neck. Stab, draw, no flash, pull out, stabbing. Like every 2-3 seconds or so. I've walked in on dudes trying to shoot up in their dicks. Another dude trying to shoot in an open wound. People with giant gauge, LONG ass needles... fishing around in their groin, trying to find thier femoral vein (often hitting the artery and almost bleeding out). And others... just spending hours, and hours, trying to hit veins WAY to far gone.

So. I'm sort of wondering if someone could see a doctor/surgeon and have some sort of IV access put in. I know it can be risky, but wouldn't be a good ""harm reduction"" tool? They hand out a whole bunch of needles, and supplies... so wouldn't this be the next reasonable step?

Have you got this same model? I bet many of you have. I’ve had mine for going on 15 years.

I thought it was time to pay homage, so I had an AI engine produce a little poem for it:

&#x200B;

In realms of measure, fine and fair,

A Gemini-20 scale takes to air.

A jewel in the alchemist's hand,

Weighing potions in a delicate stand.

&#x200B;

Gemini twins in precision dance,

Balancing the fates, a careful trance.

A scale of science, discreet and small,

Measuring powders, one by one, they fall.

&#x200B;

With digits dancing, numbers align,

A symphony of balance, so divine.

Tiny crystals, whispers on the breeze,

As Gemini-20 works with gentle ease.

&#x200B;

In grams and grains, its secrets unfold,

A mystic dance in a mortar of gold.

Substances weighed, with utmost care,

Alchemy whispers in the Gemini air.

&#x200B;

Oh, precision gem, of science's delight,

Measuring the tinctures that shimmer in light.

In the hands of seekers, the meticulous scribe,

Gemini-20, where elements imbibe.

&#x200B;

Whispers of chemistry, a silent song,

As Gemini-20 measures the throng.

Each crystal a story, each powder a tale,

In the dance of the scale, mysteries unveil.

&#x200B;

So, in the laboratory's sacred room,

Gemini-20 dispels the shroud of gloom.

A gem in the hands of those who seek,

The balance of science, where mysteries peek.

&#x200B;

Finally, on a serious note: use it. Weigh your gear, test your gear… in fact follow the entire *10 Commandments of Safer Drug Use* ([https://www.drugusersbible.com/p/safety-procedures.html](https://www.drugusersbible.com/p/safety-procedures.html)). Stay safe.

codependency vs. harm reduction/being a friend,"crossposted from some codependency groups! I did not get much feedback from those yet, so posting here as well. thanks! 

ok, I'll tryyy to keep the context short. 

skip to the *** if you don't wanna read so much. 

I met my ex when I was 22 and he was 46, at a play party. We started off just fooling around, but ended up in a relationship that in the end turned out to be pretty codependent. 

From the get-go, I was aware of his regular drug use (meth regularly, and others more recreationally). I didn't touch any drug the first year we were together, barely had a sip of alcohol. I learned about harm reduction and I continue to, still - it's important to me. After that first year I started doing k and g occasionally, recreationally. And then during the pandemic lockdown there were big changes happening in his life (mainly, getting evicted and becoming houseless) that I supported him through, without realizing the toll it was taking on me (physically, mentally, energetically; I supported financially too but that I was aware of). Over the span of about a year, I found myself doing k more regularly to cope, having a total mental breakdown, was self harming and suicidal, I lashed out and (emotionally) hurt his other partner at the time, for no reason other than feeling abandoned by him, which resulted in us breaking up while they continued to date (he was the middle of the V in our non-monogamous relationship). and then I got a bit violent, still in this dark headspace in a moment of feeling abandoned (he wasn't picking up my calls), I threw objects and glass around an abandoned house he was attempting to clean up and squat (essentially, I invaded and trashed his space) and verbally (well, over text) lashed out at his other partner again, after they already set a boundary with me. this resulted in a big yelling confrontation, and him setting a firm boundary with me. he blocked me on everything and we had no contact for 8 months. I found myself with absolutely no sense of self or community, because I had made his world my world the whole time we were together, and now I was cut off, and I had neglected myself nearly the whole time we were together (did not have any hobbies or communities of my own). So, I started trying to build that for myself, and still am. the time away was helpful, I started taking care of myself again, but I did find myself lonely still.

then, he reached out because he didn't want our last conversation to be what it was, so I agreed to meet up and we got to have a calm, sort of healing conversation. him and his other partner had broken up, I had picked up some hobbies. we started hanging out again as friends, and then fucking again (still as friends), and I got better at practicing boundaries around my time. it felt like we were solid, good friends. he helped me move homes, I took him to a health clinic when he was sick and visited him in the hospital when he had an infection, big close friend things. we care about each other, we love each other. 

except sometimes, I find myself slipping into codependency, and I don't know how to find a balance. He has a camp now, with electricity and a porta potty, but it's still rough. He has a couple friends who he visits for a shower/meal/indoor place to sleep for a night or two, including me. and I want to be a reliable friend, I want to be available for that, but it also makes it hard for me to say no when I don't feel like hanging out with him. lately, I've been feeling this discomfort around him and I'm realizing I just want to spend less time with him. 

*** hypothetically, it's easier to say ""call me when you need me, and I'll be there"" to someone who has equal resources. I want to be able to say that to him, maybe even BECAUSE I have more resources. I believe that access to food, water, shelter, people IS harm reduction, I don't want him to be hungry when he's having issues with food stamps. but, also, what if I don't want to spend time with him like once a week? what if I need physical space for a month or two? is it fair to want that, knowing he could be struggling and I could easily provide something? 

I ended up, yesterday, texting him that I need a break from hanging out. I didn't say how long for, but I feel a little relieved and a little guilty. I told him I feel like I'm lying about myself around him, like I'm wearing a mask but I don't know what the truth is. Which is true. I find myself putting on an agreeable face sometimes, or I want to hang out quietly, I want him to stop talking, or I want to talk about something on MY mind, but it's so hard to say those things in person (that's why I texted him about needing a break). I think there are also things I'm grieving about our relationship too. I'm 28 now and I'm still struggling a bit to build community for myself. idk, I just need some space again. it just feels like I'm being a little unfair, somehow.",5,8,2024-01-26 17:18:05,codependency vs. harm reduction/being friend crossposted codependency groups get much feedback yet posting well thanks ok 'll tryyy keep context short skip n't wan na read much met ex 22 46 play party started fooling around ended relationship end turned pretty codependent get-go aware regular drug use meth regularly others recreationally n't touch drug first year together barely sip alcohol learned harm reduction continue still 's important first year started k g occasionally recreationally pandemic lockdown big changes happening life mainly getting evicted becoming houseless supported without realizing toll taking physically mentally energetically supported financially aware span year found k regularly cope total mental breakdown self harming suicidal lashed emotionally hurt partner time reason feeling abandoned resulted us breaking continued date middle v non-monogamous relationship got bit violent still dark headspace moment feeling abandoned n't picking calls threw objects glass around abandoned house attempting clean squat essentially invaded trashed space verbally well text lashed partner already set boundary resulted big yelling confrontation setting firm boundary blocked everything contact 8 months found absolutely sense self community made world world whole time together cut neglected nearly whole time together hobbies communities started trying build still time away helpful started taking care find lonely still reached n't want last conversation agreed meet got calm sort healing conversation partner broken picked hobbies started hanging friends fucking still friends got better practicing boundaries around time felt like solid good friends helped move homes took health clinic sick visited hospital infection big close friend things care love except sometimes find slipping codependency n't know find balance camp electricity porta potty 's still rough couple friends visits shower/meal/indoor place sleep night two including want reliable friend want available also makes hard say n't feel like hanging lately 've feeling discomfort around 'm realizing want spend less time hypothetically 's easier say `` call need 'll '' someone equal resources want able say maybe even resources believe access food water shelter people harm reduction n't want hungry 's issues food stamps also n't want spend time like week need physical space month two fair want knowing could struggling could easily provide something ended yesterday texting need break hanging n't say long feel little relieved little guilty told feel like 'm lying around like 'm wearing mask n't know truth true find putting agreeable face sometimes want hang quietly want stop talking want talk something mind 's hard say things person 's texted needing break think also things 'm grieving relationship 'm 28 'm still struggling bit build community idk need space feels like 'm little unfair somehow

A Gentleman’s Original Snus: What Could Possibly Go Wrong?,"Snus originated from snuff in the early 18th century, and is consumed sublabially (placed between the lip and gum). It is particularly popular in Sweden, which of course is where I headed for the experiment.

Note that its nicotine content can vary, with some blends using a particularly strong form of tobacco. I was aware of this, but it was *only* tobacco, so what could possibly go wrong?

The following excerpt, from *The Drug Users Bible*, describes my sorry tale:

# THE SNUS EXPERIENCE

Having a few hours to spare whilst in Copenhagen, I hopped over to Sweden specifically to sample snus at its global epicentre. On arrival I quickly found a tobacconist and asked for the most traditional and popular variety. I was provided with the following, which the proprietor described as “*a* *gentleman’s original snus*”:

[Snus](https://preview.redd.it/88l8kwmbklec1.jpg?width=3691&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efb1d3651975fc075fa1c72f037740de2a7c5923)

On leaving the shop I placed one of those packets between my gum and upper lip, and held it there for some minutes. It was hot and burning, and the taste, which ran down the back of my throat, wasn’t at all nice. I held on but it didn’t get any better.

Five minutes in I was feeling a little sickly and dizzy, and had to expel it and sit down. There was stimulation present, but the icky feel was primary. On nine minutes I was feeling pretty sorry for myself. The dizziness was now worse, and the rather poorly background had not dissipated in the least.

Did I get any sympathy from my patiently waiting colleague? Not exactly: I was told that I was an a$$ehole. This at least made me chuckle.

The good news is that at twenty minutes I felt that I was on the road to recovery, even though I still felt ill and just wanted to curl up in a bed. After half an hour, although I hadn’t recovered I was well enough to walk again and continue with my day.

This was definitely not one for me. It was, perhaps unsurprisingly, like a diluted re-run of my mapacho and rapé experiences. Note that I discerned no lag or after effects, either during the afternoon or the following day.

If I have failed to do justice to this, please bear in mind that I am not a smoker (of tobacco). This was way too much for my disposition.

\-----------------

I can offer little in the way of excuses for this latest mishap. I’d been burned previously courtesy of strong tobacco types (mapacho) but I somehow assumed that sublabial consumption would render the exercise easier to manage. It didn’t.

On reflection this is another I could probably file this under *don’t do what I did*. It could have been far worse.

Using Black Tar; Harm Reduction Questions,"hello, I have been a user of IV ""heroin"" on and off for 20 years. As many of us are now aware there is very little quality dope going around recently. I have tested my supply and have stopped buying/using the stuff with xylazine or Tranc.   My plug has black tar though and I have started using that and mixing up shots with the ""fetty"".    **My current process** with the tar involves using a cooker and mixing it up with water and then adding heat using a flame from a lighter. I cook it until it bubbles and stir it until the dope mixture is more watery.  The mixture is a dark reddish brown and I draw it  up using a clean 29 gauge/.5 inch./100 cc syringe through a cotton filter.  

 **I have always wondered about particulates in the dope mixture !**  So with the tar sometimes I see small particles of the dope in the syringe, sometimes the mix is pretty muddy and gooey. I know that temperature affects the consistency. What happens if there is a little bit of shmutz in the rig?  At what point does particles in the shot mixture increase risk?  

**What about air bubbles?:**  I have always wondered about air bubbles in the shot mixture. I know in the movies they show you can kill someone with an air bubble injected into their veins. With tar heroin there are a bunch of bubbles sometimes.  At what point is an air bubble/Air bubbles a concern for injecting users?

I have some scar tissue around one of my veins that I hit frequently, nevertheless it is still the best place to hit sometimes. It is not infected and I use a spray bottle of cleaning alcohol before and after my shots. My question is this: **if you poke into a vein can a piece of tissue get unlodged and cause damage elsewhere?**  I figure that if a piece of tissue got into the vein it could get stuck somewhere and cause an aneurysms or something?  

I would love to  see what knowledge you guys have or how you practice ways to stay safe, any tips or info specific to black tar would be welcomed.  Thank you.

Anybody here get muscle spasms/involuntary movements on stims and fixed the issue ? Has anybody in here that used stims lowered there high resting heart rate with exercise over time ?,"Seems I’ve developed some kind of weird tremor, I’m wondering if it’s just due to overstimulation. But basically when I play video games I take 40 mg vyvanse and 1-2 caffeine pills so 200-400mg caffeine. I’ve noticed lately I’ve been developing a sort of involuntary movement kind of thing where sometimes I feel like my arms contracts on its own almost like a cramp. In my bicep. Or sometimes I’m gaming on my pc and I feel like my arm moved more than I wanted it too.  

A bit afraid, I’m hoping that it’s something simple like some kind of deficiency that I just need to get fixed. Which wouldn’t be surprising bc lately I haven’t been eating as much as I should. Also I’m wondering if anybody here has successfully lowered there heart rate via cardio and if the stims have less side effects due to more cardiac efficiency over time.

 I ask this bc I notice my heart rate while I’m gaming goes up a little wayyyy too high when I’m try Harding I have my Apple Watch on and my heart rate tends to jump up to 120-130 and sometimes even 140bpm and I can tell that’s not healthy. And it might even be related to the tremors/involuntary movements thing. I had a panic attack cause I thought I was having a heart attack so I wen to the ER last week and they did blood work and an EKG and both of those came out fine.

"Don’t IV, But If You Must IV….","I thought long and hard about including this in the book, but as I did throughout I eventually decided that *people will be people*, and that ultimately *ignorance kills and education saves lives*. As extracted from *The Drug Users Bible*:

# RISK MITIGATION FOR IV

As stated earlier, injecting (IV) is a terrible idea from a safety perspective. However, if you are using this RoA regardless, specialist websites commonly offer the following tips to mitigate some of the risks. \[Note: Consult these sites directly for greater detail.\]

&#x200B;

>•	Only inject in a clean safe environment and make sure that equipment and other items are clean and are readily to hand.  
>  
>•	Prepare in advance for an overdose (e.g. have people around to check on you). If you are using an opioid have some naloxone available, if possible. Also have contact details for the emergency services to hand.  
>  
>•	Always prepare for yourself and always inject yourself.  
>  
>•	Never share needles or equipment, including with your partner.  
>  
>•	Always use a new capped needle.  
>  
>•	Make sure that the injection site on your skin is clean.  
>  
>•	If sharing a drug, split it before use. Failing this, at least ensure that a fresh container is used for each hit (and no re-use or re-dipping of needles).  
>  
>•	Use filters to help remove impurities.  
>  
>•	Remove air bubbles (e.g. point upwards, push gently and flick).  
>  
>•	Use an unshared tourniquet.  
>  
>•	Don’t inject into an artery; only a vein.  
>  
>•	If you don’t find a vein straight away use a new needle. Take your time.  
>  
>•	Don’t inject into your hands (the veins are too small).  
>  
>•	Never inject into an area that’s swollen or sore.  
>  
>•	Try to rotate injection sites.  
>  
>•	Insert the needle at a 45 degree angle, injecting towards the heart (in the direction of the blood flow).  
>  
>•	Make sure that the needle’s hole is facing upwards.  
>  
>•	Make sure that you are in a vein (you should see blood if you push slightly and then draw-back a little). \[Note: only draw-back minimally\]  
>  
>•	If the blood is brighter/pink-red, rather than dark/black-red you are injecting into an artery. Abort immediately and stem the bleeding.  
>  
>•	Release the tourniquet and inject slowly, keeping arm straight.  
>  
>•	Remove the needle slowly.  
>  
>•	Apply a light press to the injection site to stem blood flow.  
>  
>•	Secure and recap your syringe ready for return or safe disposal.  
>  
>•	Clean-up everything (e.g. with bleach) and finally clean yourself.  
>  
>•	If you have problems with bleeding or swelling seek medical help urgently.

Does anyone know how often you can dose valium to avoid tolerance/dependency and subsequent withdrawals?,"I have BPD and trauma and valium is one of the only things that helps me to cope sometimes. I don't have an addictive personality thankfully, but in the past I've been through benzo withdrawals (aka hell on earth) simply from not understanding/having access to reliable information about how often you can actually take these drugs while avoiding a tolerance (docs always just say to use them as sparingly as possible if at all and treat you suspiciously/get gatekeepy and cagey if you want to know anything more). 

I'm trying to practice responsible use and harm reduction but it's really hard when the answers you get from most legitimate sources are just scaldings and a blanket ""you should just minimise it and use it sparingly if at all""...and like, no I'm not going to minimise one of the only successful coping strategies I have that actually fucking works for a serious, life-threatening condition. My goal is to maximise its SAFE use, ie to use it as much as I can when I need it without developing tolerance and dependency. If anyone has actual data or medical information around this I'd really appreciate it

Feedback Needed: AI Harm Reduction Training App with Substance-Specific Modules,"Dia duit everyone,


I’ve worked in the harm reduction field for the last 10 years, in low threshold services, homeless hostels, outreach services and residential rehab centres in Ireland and Canada

My current employer in Belfast, Ireland has been able to obtain a small innovation grant.
So I’m trying to develop an AI-enhanced training app for harm reduction in Ireland,




The app hopefully will feature comprehensive modules, including:

	1.	Overdose Prevention
	2.	Syringe Access
	3.	Safer Drug Use
	4.	Fentanyl Awareness
	5.	MOUD (Medication for Opioid Use Disorder)
	6.	Hepatitis C
	7.	Support for Sex Workers
	8.	Supervised Consumption
	9.	Xylazine Awareness
	10.	Harm Reduction Advocacy
	11.	Training on Opioids, Benzodiazepines, and Pregabalin - key substances impacting Ireland

Plus, an AI-driven resource directory tailored to local needs.

It would be really helpful to get some input on:

Relevance and depth of these modules
Suggestions for the resource directory
Any other feedback 


It’s a very small project but since the services here are all under funded with little resources, I’m hoping I can make the work a bit easier.

I recently completed my MSc in Substance Use Disorders with a dissertation focusing on peer and frontline worker advocacy in low threshold overdose prevention services, so would love to be able to use this opportunity to improve harm reduction services here in Ireland.",7,16,2024-01-16 20:51:33,feedback needed ai harm reduction training app substance-specific modules dia duit everyone ’ worked harm reduction field last 10 years low threshold services homeless hostels outreach services residential rehab centres ireland canada current employer belfast ireland able obtain small innovation grant ’ trying develop ai-enhanced training app harm reduction ireland app hopefully feature comprehensive modules including 1. overdose prevention 2. syringe access 3. safer drug use 4. fentanyl awareness 5. moud medication opioid use disorder 6. hepatitis c 7. support sex workers 8. supervised consumption 9. xylazine awareness 10. harm reduction advocacy 11. training opioids benzodiazepines pregabalin key substances impacting ireland plus ai-driven resource directory tailored local needs would really helpful get input relevance depth modules suggestions resource directory feedback ’ small project since services funded little resources ’ hoping make work bit easier recently completed msc substance use disorders dissertation focusing peer frontline worker advocacy low threshold overdose prevention services would love able use opportunity improve harm reduction services ireland

more advice on codeine pls,"me again hello

after my last post i thought “fuck it” and took 4 co codamol (still prescription so i had 120mg codeine/2000mg paracetamol). 6 hours later i took another 4, totalling to 240mg codeine and 4000mg paracetamol in 24 hours which is apparently the maximum dose of paracetamol in 24 hours. 

its been about 6 hours since then and i want to have more, is it too risky to take another 4 cos of the paracetamol content? like i said in my last post im not doing this to hurt myself, it just makes me feel good lol. if it is too risky, does anyone know when i can have another 4? like do i have to wait a full 24 hours from when i took my last pill or what?

It's okay not to be okay,"##Really. I promise.

When it comes to addiction, a lot of the time people always try to only focus on positivity (of sobriety).

- ""I don't let drugs beat me!""  
- ""I won't let addiction keep me from doing what I love!""   
- ""I'll fight hard every day!""  

There's definitely a core of truth to maintaining a positive attitude throughout this disease, but I also find that too often, it comes at the expense of not allowing yourself to feel the bad parts. Because sometimes, acknowledging that you're not okay when it comes to drugs/addiction feels like a huge personal failure. Like you weren't trying hard enough. Like you should have known and done better. Because how can you keep up with being positive if you let the negative interfere?

I want you all to know that it's so very much okay to not be okay. You're allowed to feel frustrated, stressed, and tired. You're allowed to be fed up with this shit. You're allowed to curse at drugs and the ignorance spread about our condition.

We're finite and we're human. This shit wears us down, **addiction is really hard**, *and that's okay.* It would be weird if this stuff didn't negatively impact us.

Don't get caught in the positivity trap, where you only allow yourself to feel positive things because you have to 'or else'. You don't have to be positive all the time. It's super important for us to feel these frustrations and all the other bullshit so we can process them rather than push them aside and bottle them up until they cave in on us. Doing so is known to help prevent burnout and makes for happier, healthier people.

Give yourself the space and time to feel the bad stuff. Be sad, cry, punch things at the gym, go for a long and lonely walk. Yell, play violent games, listen to heavy metal, bitch at friends! Do all these things so you don't get stuck pent up in the background and unable to move forward.

You'll feel so much better if you give yourself permission to feel these things. Take a nap or go to bed for the night afterward, and when you wake up, reflect and plan.

Why were you feeling this way? Can you trace it back to one specific event, or does it feel like an accumulation of many things? Are you setting reasonable expectations for yourself, or are you holding yourself to a really high standard that is setting you up for failure?

Be honest with yourself and your expectations. Once you have answered these kinds of questions, you have to:

- Processed the emotions attached to the situation, at least partially  

- A better understanding of what's going on to make you feel this way, or clues to follow up on in the next step to figure that out  

- The ability to start planning on ways to make things easier for you.  

**Remember to take it one step at a time. Focus on what you** ***can*** **do. Be kind to yourself, you deserve it.**

It's okay to not have the answer to fix your most pressing issues. What's important is to make a list and go down it, and deal with each item one piece at a time. Can you delegate x obligation that's stressing you out? Do it! Can you skip or reassign chores to make things fairer and less burdensome? Do it! Can you set reminders on your phone to remember your meds? Do it! One thing at a time.

As important as it is to acknowledge the bad, please also celebrate your accomplishments. Even if it's just a small thing that 'everyone else does all the time', if you struggled with it but you did it anyway, you should be proud of that achievement. Don't measure yourself by what others do, drug dependence (like chronic illness) is about you. Nobody else. You are your own standard, you do what you can without hurting yourself, and that is at all times excellent. It's important to understand that trying our best is all we can ask from ourselves and that trying your best doesn't mean you have to break yourself in the process.

You're valuable, you're capable, you've got this. Even when things are bad, you're no less worthy of love, support, and care. It's okay to not be okay.

"Drugs, The Darknet & The Media [My Story]","I spent much of 2023 working on the darknet. This is my story. You won’t be reading anything about it in the media anytime soon. Stay safe. :-)

# DRUGS, THE DARKNET & THE MEDIA [MY STORY]

*The darknet drug markets now provide more harm reduction information to users than both the government and the established media. How did this situation arise, and why does it remain unreported?*

—-

Furnishing individuals with safety information on their drug of choice reduces the risk of tragedy and death. This is a self-evident truth. Putting it another way, via a popular mantra: *ignorance kills education saves lives*.

[Ignorance Kills, Education Saves Lives](https://preview.redd.it/wwcbnvrpk0bc1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c08cc7b525ee24172290eac219234a01c7b89a47)

This stark and somewhat obvious premise drove a project which began more in hope than expectation almost 15 years ago. It was during the summer of 2009 that I took the first steps in writing what eventually became *The Drug Users Bible*, a best-selling 638-page harm reduction tome.

This was always going to be a serious and lengthy undertaking. I resolved to not only document every drug in common use, both chemical and botanical, but to also experience them for myself. I felt that to have credibility amongst drug consumers this was an essential pre-requisite. As someone bluntly told me at the time, if I didn’t do this I would be *like a nun offering sex education*.

What I didn’t know at the start was that I would ultimately self-administer 182 different drugs, on a journey which would have tremendous highs, but far too many horrendous and traumatic lows. Despite the latter I got there in the end, and I was more than happy with final result. It is, without doubt, helping thousands to mitigate risk and to take more informed decisions regarding drug use.

[The Drug Users Bible \[Paperback\]](https://preview.redd.it/s5oi5p0tk0bc1.jpg?width=2800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a838abd413ae371f1db2ee1b9a80c7635b02ead)

However, there was always an element of dissatisfaction in the back of mind in the form of a question: *what about the people who didn’t buy books or who couldn’t afford them*? By the summer of 2023 my imagination was running riot as I sought to resolve this troubling and perplexing issue.

**IMAGINE REACHING THOSE MOST IN NEED**

Imagine vital harm reduction information being provided without charge at point of drug purchase, on a global basis. Imagine the potential impact this might have in terms of user safety.

Is this vision really so far fetched? On visiting a doctor or a pharmacy provision of safety information is routine, and this usually extends well beyond dose, frequency and duration.

Why can’t the same apply to recreational drugs? Is there a way to integrate harm reduction into the supply chain despite the unremitting brutality of the drug war?

The answer to the latter turned out to be *yes*, at least in part.

**THE DARKNET & ITS MARKETS**

The darknet, and in particular the darknet markets, play an increasingly important role in terms of the distribution of drugs. Consumers and vendors alike source from this hidden and anonymous alternative to the visible Internet which most people are familiar with.

With respect to this, my light-bulb moment regarding the above issues came in the form of a *what-if*.

What if I created a free-of-charge PDF version of *The Drug Users Bible*? What if I could actually communicate with the owners of the markets? What if they provided this PDF without charge to customers? Was this possible? Would they even listen?

I realised immediately that, although the prospects appeared to be slim, I had to go for it: even with limited success someone somewhere might pick something up from the PDF which would save their lives. But where would I start?

**THE DARKNET HARM REDUCTION PROJECT IS BORN**

Luckily, like the Internet, the darknet has a social media stratum. This is dominated by a Reddit-like platform called *Dread*. This was the obvious start-point.

I contacted the staff there, explained my vision, and simply asked for help. With the response, an enthusiastic *yes*, I knew that this had a chance. The project was on.

*Dread* became the first darknet entity to host the PDF, and they launched it with vigour, such that even some of the markets would become aware of it. It was now obvious that I had to seize the moment.

I thus began to identify every significant market. I prepared my script and started the lengthy process of establishing a means of communication. One by one I approached them, explaining the mission and asking them to either host the PDF or to provide a link to it, so that customers (drug consumers) had the opportunity to obtain their own copy.

[The Darknet Harm Reduction Project](https://preview.redd.it/uuf5lhbwk0bc1.jpg?width=1204&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0dad7e0aef3cad979ab17f6b1f0e2719951fd08)

This took patience and persistence, and months of effort, but eventually I got there. Almost every market of any significance is now on board, thus adding to their innate regulatory functionality (such provision of an *eBay*\-like vendor rating system, which helps to protect consumers against adulterated supply). In another unexpected turn, a growing number of individual vendors are also offering the PDF at point of sale.

**THE (UNREPORTED) CONCRETE REALITY**

The more drug consumers who are exposed to harm reduction information the more effective this project becomes. So by any measure the project has exceeded all expectations, and continues to do so. It is now making a difference in the real world.

The media though (with the honourable exception of the *BBC World Service)* never fails to disappoint. My Reddit quote, below, was perhaps borne of frustration, but is nonetheless a reasonable summary of the situation:

>“*If an individual is caught selling drugs on a darknet market it is solemnly presented as a news-worthy story across much of the media landscape. If a market operator is caught it garners headlines across the world.*  
*However, when those same markets evolve to provide life-critical harm reduction material directly at point of drug sale, this significant public health development remains unreported*.”

Fortunately, this abrogation does not change the concrete reality on the ground.

**THE CAVALRY ISN’T GOING TO APPEAR**

At the very beginning I framed the context for the book, and the project, with the following commentary:

>*“People are dying because of ignorance.*  
*They are dying because unremitting propaganda is denying them vital safety information.*  
*They are dying because legislators and the media are censoring the science, and are ruthlessly pushing an ideological agenda instead.*  
*They are dying because the first casualty of war is truth, and the war on drugs is no different.”*

Although the safety data I collated and researched over so many years is now literally at the fingertips of countless thousands, this remains the case. Further, no cavalry, in the form of a benevolent government or philanthropic authority, is going to appear and suddenly provide this form of education.

This, however, is a project with which anyone can help. Thus, if you know someone who may be at risk, or who may simply appreciate further information on drug safety; please feel free to forward to them. The download is available from all the major cloud networks, as listed on this page: [https://www.drugusersbible.com/2018/01/pdf.html](https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/331fdbd7-bad7-42c2-a96a-13229b2a9cac?j=eyJ1IjoiZXpnN2EifQ.GPcXMpRvLjVnIitcyK4FrVghTPSm6u-bY3exmW4qCD0).

Despite the indifference of society at large and the many obstacles *in situ*, as a community we can reduce ignorance: we can educate. Collectively we can save more of those lives. Although this isn’t a sweeping all-encompassing solution to the misery and death inherently caused by the *war on drugs*, it is at least something.

Just a crazy cool story we heard from a participant of our SSP this evening,"Hey everyone! So tonight I was doing what I usually do on Friday nights: delivered sterile syringe and sterile smoking kits across the city we serve. I got a late call from one of our out of town participants who has been a secondary hub for us for awhile. This person is really well connected among other drug users in their area, been a wonderful partnership so far. 

Anyways, usually they’re in a hurry to get back (they come into the city to meet me once every other month to grab a bunch of kits), they still gotta drive like 1.5 hours home. But tonight they were able to hang for a bit and we got to catch up and hear about what they’ve been up against and just the general effectiveness of the current model in place for distribution….and it’s during that question that they inform me of a volunteer fire department that operates as the only first responder who can show up within an hour in their neck of the woods. 

They said “Yeah man…we kind of had a stockpile of Narcan since you give us so much and we ended up establishing a line of communication with the FD and asked what their Narcan supply looked like, when we found out they had almost none we started hooking them up and haven’t stopped since. I just look at them and say ‘I get it, I’m the local drug dealer and you’re the fire department….no chance we agree across the board, but y’all need these Narcan to carry so you can save our friends’”. 

We got drug dealers out here supplying rural fire departments with Narcan and building a bridge of communication in the process, I love this work and I especially love the population we get to chill with.

Just smoked oxy neo 40. Should I be worried?,"

Like the title says I just smoked one of the rxoxy Neos(the yellow 40 on ones) with the coating inside with my gf I tried sucking off the coating on the outside but there was clearly coating inside still it was really harsh and clearly a huge waste as well it did get us kinda high it wasn't what a 40 should do. After this I told a friend on the phone what we had done and he mentioned that he knew a girl who tried cooking them in an oven to get the coating off and snorted then and after which nearly died as the coating solidified in her lungs. This might nor be the exact same as she was snorting them and I think did allot more. But I'm still kinda worried.

rookie question about community reaction to harm redux,"Hello, I'm new to the subreddit and had a question that I would really like some thoughts on as I've struggled with how to think about it. I'm relatively new to the harm reduction movement/philosophies (have been reading more and more about it for probably a year or so) and recently moved to a small city which has been referred to as the ""overdose capital of the country"" (I think it's useless to traffic in those kind of headline-grabbing usually untrue generalizations, but basically it's a major problem here). I grew up in a more affluent town where opioids were not (at least on the surface) a major issue and a local teenager dying of an OD would make the news for a week. So when I moved to my new city I started learning more about harm redux, got trained for naloxone, etc. and while I understood that harm redux is still not widely accepted I wasn't prepared for how careless even the people here I really like are with their language around PWUD (using language like ""crackhead,"" ""dopehead,"" ""junkie,"" super casually). 

At first I wrote this kind of cruelty off as 100% an attempt to distance themselves from PWUD (i.e. calling someone a crackhead because you think you could \*never\* be ""like them"" even though that's not true) but then people would tell stories about PWUD cutting holes in their backyard fences and living in their garden sheds, or breaking into their apartments. I took (and still take) these stories with a grain of salt because it's not always possible to verify how they actually happened or who was involved. But I guess here's my question: how have you all gone about talking to community members about having greater empathy or openness to PWUD and harm redux when those same community members may have been the victims of real harm (like a break-in or parental neglect) from PWUD, or perhaps have had friends or family killed or hurt because they became ""involved"" with ""those people""? 

Maybe this sounds weird, but I think it may be easier for me to be empathetic towards PWUD than some of my neighbors or coworkers who grew up in this area and whose lives have constantly been touched by the opioid crisis because it's more remote for me so I can take what others might see as a high-horse love-based position? When I was a teenager my parents had their car broken into and I remember my dad saying that whoever was desperate enough to break the car window needed his computer more than he did, basically. This was definitely partly his Christian beliefs talking, but I think also we could almost afford to not freak out and call the cops because at the end of the day we could cobble together the cash to buy a new computer and fix the car. When my neighbors (I now live in a low-income neighborhood) talk about ""crackheads"" breaking their car windows I see real fear because they can't just up and fix the window. 

I \*want\* to be able to talk with my neighbors about things like harm redux but I worry that until my life is more immediately touched by the overdose crisis I am almost not credible? Even if I believe that the vast majority of PWUD are not ""primed"" to commit crimes, I can't figure out how to tell that to a neighbor who has seem people squatting in their backyard in order to use. I think I would also be scared if I saw someone living in my backyard, even if I would also (I hope) try to be compassionate. People from this city tell me our city is dangerous - sometimes I feel like: who am I to explain that I think that danger comes from criminalization, hatred of the poor etc. when I've lived here for 3 months? Anyone else struggle with this? Anyone have ideas of how to reckon with it? I know some people in recovery believe strongly in ""making amends"" with people they may have harmed while in regular use and I'm sure that sometimes cultivates greater understanding from their community but obviously I don't think the work should totally have to fall on PWUD and/or people in recovery to grow this empathy and support for harm redux (esp because of the cruelty they already encounter).

Efferalgan codeine,"I’m in a country I can basically get this otc. It is 30mg codeine x 500mg acetaminophen/paracetamol. It’s an effervescent tablet.

2. I am not sure I’m in a situation I can even do cwe (complicated)

I’m using this for severe back pain as I don’t have my oxycodone with me. I’d like to take more than 60mg codeine per 4 hrs at times (say 90mg)

1. Am I correct cwe can’t be done?
2. If I occasionally had to take 3 tablets (1.5g paracetamol), would a large dose of AcetylCysteine mitigate liver problems? (I have 25g also acquired in this country). This isn’t a long-term behavior—about a week until my travel is over

Ethics and boundaries in harm reduction work,"I've been working in the harm reduction field for ten years now, mostly with homeless or precariously housed folks who access supervised consumption services, and I've seen front line services change dramatically. I have lived experience with substance use and am also licensed to practice, and I work alongside people from all backgrounds - licenced professionals (doctors, nurses, social workers, psychotherapists), harm reduction and outreach workers, and peers (current/former service users). I've been looking for resources that discuss personal boundaries between workers and service users and haven't been able to find much, so I'm hoping to start a discussion about this. 

I've noticed that many new harm reduction workers are eager to form connections with service users by adding them on social media or exchanging contact info, and I can't help but question the ethics of building these relationships outside of the workplace due to the risk of harm. A lot of these workers are not from this specific community, though may have shared similar challenges in the past, they may possess more power and privilege in their current position than before. Many service users and peers do not possess the same level of power and privilege as workers in the field, and if we are not reflexive of the power dynamics inherent in these relationships, we run a great risk of causing harm. I also draw a distinction between peers who are currently or formerly part of the community of service users and workers with lived experience of substance use more generally. Of course personal boundaries between current/former community members will be different due to their dual relationship, but I don't think the same can be said for all workers with lived experience. 

I've seen times when these relationships have caused harm to the service user, after a breakup or a falling out with a worker, causing someone to relapse, use more, OD more frequently, and have even seen workers blacklist service users from sites due to these interpersonal challenges.

I realize there are a lot of issues with professionalizing harm reduction work, and that's not at all where I'm coming from, but I think there needs to be a bigger conversation about personal and professional/working boundaries. As workers in the harm reduction field I do believe it is our duty to minimize harm to others, which must also take into consideration how our non-working relationships with service users may impact their wellbeing.

Cutting big Pharma out of naracan,"Hello. I spent my younger years traveling and have been a drug user on and off for most of my life. I've used harm reduction services more times than I can count. If it wasn't for the Naracan that I received from harm reduction services all over the country so many people would not be alive today, I honestly don't know how many overdoses I have reversed. From my friends and partners to random people on the streets. It is a vital tool for drug users and people who are around drug users to keep people alive. Today I found out that the boxes of nasal naracan cost around 150$ a piece. For the box of just two. And the injectable naracan is very very cheap. The reason it's so expensive is a pharmaceutical company owns the patent for the device that is used to actually spray the Naracan into someone's nose. So I was wondering if anyone knows if there is a actual difference between the nasal naracan or the intermuscular, and if someone could 3D print the device and cut out a huge chunk of the cost. If anyone has any knowledge here, it's an idea to make the cost of nasal naracan alot less. Mostly I just don't want the same big Pharma company that started the opioid epidemic to profit from saving the people who's life they ruined.

I use recreational drugs fairly often(anywhere from 2x a week to 6x a week; sometimes mixing substances, sometimes only using one thing the entire week;), and tend to use cocaine, xanax, and klonopin the most frequently as of currently and i smoke weed as well to help me sleep at night, it's always dispensary stuff though; i assume that smoking while taking seroquel wont do too much harm,(especially since it's not street weed), but if i am wrong please correct me!!(I do however go through phases of what I am using, so information about other drugs would be very appreciated as well; anything from opioids to psychedelics!)I tried doing some internet sleuthing to find drug interactions with seroquel, and maybe i just didn't look hard enough, but i came up empty.

What's a good way to do a test run with Propranolol for stage fright?,"My psychiatrist prescribed me Propranolol after I told him that I can't play music live anymore since I quit drinking.

Bipolar 2 patient and replacing THC,"Hi there, I take medicine and supplements to manage my bipolar disorder type 2. I've used weed for pretty much my whole life. I use CBD more now, but I think I have to cut down or cut out THC due to the risk posed by permanent psychosis among other things. I used to think of THC as my safe upper, my safest mood enhancing drug. I'm working with my psychiatrist on addressing insomnia I get with cessation of thc.

Now I feel like I'm in a weird position where it makes sense for me to stop using my ""safe drug"" and start using drugs I looked at with suspicion. I'm on kratom, now. I'm thinking of doing N Acetyl Cysteine so maybe I won't want to use any at all. I've been researching other drugs like these. So far I am thinking kava kava, microdose psilocybin, maybe micro dose lsd, try ketamine, nitrous

According to some doctors on r/psychiatry that evidence is mounting that thc would more likely to cause permanent psychosis compared to hallucinogens and mild opiates or even benzodiazepines, nitrous, might be less harmful to me.

I need interviews about harm reduction in the US and anyone can do it :),"
Would any of you be willing to do a 10-minute email interview? I would send the questions, you will type the answers and email them back. It won't be published just used to gather information. 

The interview would be 5 short, open-ended questions about harm reduction and the community, how it is helping, what should be done, etc. 

It doesn't matter if you have an active role in the field, just support harm reduction, or are a former or current addict (these voices are just as important).

Thank you so much.

EDIT: I realized I don't need to do the whole email thing here on Reddit so I am putting the interview questions the my post :)

Here is the interview - you cam DM it to me OR just do it in the comments! Its totally annonamoys besides the part where I need to know why its important to you.

Thanks so much.

**INTERVIEW:**

Please state why harm reduction is important to YOU (just a simple few words or a sentence about how drug addiction/ OD/ substance abuse has affected you or why you are passionate about helping the cause).

How does harm reduction benefit the community on an individual level?

What steps can the community take to reduce the stigma around harm reduction?

What is the most common environment (i.e., at home, parties, homeless, etc.) where people use unsafely?

Why is promoting harm reduction more effective at reducing overdoses than promoting totally abstaining from drug use? Or do you disagree with that statement, and why?

Hey hi! I'm an advocate for reform in mental healthcare, substance abuse recovery, and (especially) the justice system. I'm an undergrad student currently researching the intersections between mental health, shortcomings in accessibility of care, and one's likelihood of being arrested.

If you're willing, I'd love to hear responses from folks in this community. Please note that, while my survey is long and does contain references to topics that may be triggering (life ending, hurting, substance abuse, etc.), respondents can (and are encouraged to!) skip over any section that is too sensitive for them. I want to hear your story without it causing harm to you. So, please, share as much (or as little) as you're comfortable with. It's all helpful.

[Check out the survey here.](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=B4Aw83xHcEqIiTRhGBfFWgYIgKuvv31FopwfIl2eiS9UMVA2SUxQWVhIQ0E3RTFMVDNTWVBEQkFGQy4u) I'm accepting answers until Nov 01 2023.

*A note about information disclosure/informed consent:*

I’m just an undergraduate student, so my research is very informal, and very limited in scope. I don’t have a prof overseeing me; I’m doing this of my own volition. I’m presenting later this semester (in a capstone course) about rehabilitative justice, mental illness in corrections, etc. I thought about my experiences with psych hospitals and substance use, so I thought it could be useful to hear other peoples’ experiences with corrections, psych treatment, and substance use.

I will be presenting my project, including some (but likely not all) of the findings of this survey twice: once privately (in my class), and later that same day publicly (for a small student organisation I’m in that’s interested in the topic). I have no interest in publishing these results anywhere, nor do I intend to share the detailed results (i.e., complete, but still anonymous, reports) with anyone else. It’ll just be “x% of respondents picked choice A instead of B or C” and select redacted quotes provided by participants. I’m not trying to do any groundbreaking work or make any profound academic statement. I’m not funded by anyone, nor do I have any interest in profiting off of this. I just want to hear peoples’ stories and hopefully get a better perspective so I can personally learn more.

I underline this in the survey itself, but all of this is of course anonymous. the only break in anonymity is if people CHOOSE to give a contact email for further interviews. However, I do not want peoples’ names (I specifically asked for an alias) and the ONLY person who will see any of that info is me, behind my locked, 2FA-backed account. It’s secure. I’ll probably use encrypted email when I reach out to folks too, just for added protection. And when I quote folks? It’ll be “respondent 1 said this” and such. No names or initials or anything.

If you have ANY other questions about disclosure, info sharing, etc., PLEASE ask. I only want to be transparent. I’m just a student who wants to make a cohesive and meaningful presentation.",1,0,2023-10-18 05:19:31,mod approved survey experience psych hospitals substance use/abuse legal problems survey https //forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx id=b4aw83xhceqiitrhgbffwgyigkuvv31fopwfil2eis9umva2suxqwvhiq0e3rtfmvdntwvbeqkfgqy4u approved moderators https //www.reddit.com/r/drugs/ allowing shared hey hi 'm advocate reform mental healthcare substance abuse recovery especially justice system 'm undergrad student currently researching intersections mental health shortcomings accessibility care one 's likelihood arrested 're willing 'd love hear responses folks community please note survey long contain references topics may triggering life ending hurting substance abuse etc respondents encouraged skip section sensitive want hear story without causing harm please share much little 're comfortable 's helpful check survey https //forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx id=b4aw83xhceqiitrhgbffwgyigkuvv31fopwfil2eis9umva2suxqwvhiq0e3rtfmvdntwvbeqkfgqy4u 'm accepting answers nov 01 2023 note information disclosure/informed consent ’ undergraduate student research informal limited scope ’ prof overseeing ’ volition ’ presenting later semester capstone course rehabilitative justice mental illness corrections etc thought experiences psych hospitals substance use thought could useful hear peoples ’ experiences corrections psych treatment substance use presenting project including likely findings survey twice privately class later day publicly small student organisation ’ ’ interested topic interest publishing results anywhere intend share detailed results i.e. complete still anonymous reports anyone else ’ “ x respondents picked choice instead b c ” select redacted quotes provided participants ’ trying groundbreaking work make profound academic statement ’ funded anyone interest profiting want hear peoples ’ stories hopefully get better perspective personally learn underline survey course anonymous break anonymity people choose give contact email interviews however want peoples ’ names specifically asked alias person see info behind locked 2fa-backed account ’ secure ’ probably use encrypted email reach folks added protection quote folks ’ “ respondent 1 said ” names initials anything questions disclosure info sharing etc. please ask want transparent ’ student wants make cohesive meaningful presentation

Was it fentanyl?,"Using a throwaway. 

Semi regular cocaine user. Tonight I took a small bump of cocaine in a bar bathroom from a baggie i had indulged in already and by the time I had gotten out of the stall and back into the bar, I felt dizzy, my eyelids felt heavy, I felt nauseous, with an immediate warm and fuzzy feeling, like I could lay down and sleep on the floor of the bar if I was allowed to.

I kept myself standing and walking around but felt like I could pass out at any moment. Was with friends and had to leave the bar for outside because I was so out of it and sleepy. Felt itchy and my pupils were pinpricks. Did not feel myself for around 1-2 hours and then seemed to snap out of it. Have limited memory for the time I left the bathroom until around 30 mins later. I’ve never had this sort of reaction from coke. 

I told my friends but they kept using from the same source with no adverse effect. Still a lot left. Tested the sample when I got home (filled the empty baggie with water and used a fent test strip) and results came out as invalid - the positive line was very strong and bold and the control was very very faint. Sadly we only had one test and it was expired so I’m not sure if we can trust it.  

Chances that this was fentanyl? I am really shaken up. This was around 5 hours ago and I can’t sleep because I feel like something really scary happened.

Taking Narcan from NaloxBox and selling it?,"So a few months ago I installed a NaloxBox outside my town’s library, right by a bus stop and busy intersection. I was really happy with the location, especially because I didn’t expect the board to approve the box in the first place. 

In any case, it was encouraging to see how often people used it. Recently there’d been a spike in the amount of Narcan being taken, and I hadn’t put much thought into it. 

Well today it’s brought to my attention from someone that helps me stock the box that there’s apparently someone taking the Narcan and selling it. 

I’m admittedly kind of naive, but I find this downrightght wicked. What’s worse is that if this in fact happening I feel like it would only reinforce misguided and unhelpful attitudes about harm reduction. Especially where I live in Bumblefuck, IN.

"switching ROA, to gradually stop","Hi, i want to stop smoking ice, and gradually stop using it. 

When i buy i don't want to keep it in a bag available for smoking, it make it difficult to resist for recreational use.

I want to find a way to prepare it in advance, and stock the result for morning uses to focus on work or to have enough energy to be ok to go out to socialize. 

I'm thinking about 2 solutions for this:

* I got many small glass bottles 42ml, can i mix ice with water, and stock it in fridge? 
* I got melatonin in capsule that i can easily open. Is it ok to put ice inside instead? 

&#x200B;

For both solutions:

* Does it actually work well for ROA? 
* What would be a ""good"" microdosing for work and socializing? 
* How long can i keep the result (bottles/capsules)? And in what storage's condition (fridge for bottle, dry place for capsule)? 

Any other solutions to plan dosing in advance for oral use? 

Is switching from smoking to drinking will help to fight craving and be in better contrôle and hopefully be able to get back to normal life ? 

 

cheers

How can I help a friend unlearn harmful bias/views towards fentanyl users?,"I need advice, but here’s a bit of information I believe is important.

So, my friend has a lot of negative bias around fentanyl users. She’s just very derogatory towards them because she sees fentanyl as an extremely evil drug, never good, etc. I believe this is mainly due to two of our mutual friends who are hardcore fentanyl abusers, she’s seen a lot of shit and has been put through shit due to their addiction so I get that it’d be hard to shake that automatic subconscious connection of fentanyl being bad.

We want to start a harm reduction centre together eventually in our city since one doesn’t exist. She called someone a ‘fent head’ over text (privately to me) and I mentioned that she can’t successfully work in harm reduction if she’s going to discriminate between fentanyl users and other drug users. She agreed that I was right, and now she wants to learn how to stop bearing a negative mindset on fentanyl users but she’s not sure how to unlearn said behaviour. 

She would genuinely like to better herself, but I’m not really sure how to help either or what direction to go in to help her as I’ve personally never held a bias against any sort of drug. I told her that she’s acknowledged the flaw that she’d like to work on and that’s already an incredible step forward, I just don’t know where to go from here.

She has no negative bias towards any other drug, she’s actually quite progressive with her views, but fentanyl is definitely a bump in the road for her which I would like to help her overcome. 

Are there any articles, tips, personal experiences, or anything else I could show her that you guys know of about unlearning harmful biases, specifically around drugs/drug use(rs)? I appreciate everything!",17,11,2023-10-03 12:57:49,help friend unlearn harmful bias/views towards fentanyl users need advice ’ bit information believe important friend lot negative bias around fentanyl users ’ derogatory towards sees fentanyl extremely evil drug never good etc believe mainly due two mutual friends hardcore fentanyl abusers ’ seen lot shit put shit due addiction get ’ hard shake automatic subconscious connection fentanyl bad want start harm reduction centre together eventually city since one ’ exist called someone ‘ fent head ’ text privately mentioned ’ successfully work harm reduction ’ going discriminate fentanyl users drug users agreed right wants learn stop bearing negative mindset fentanyl users ’ sure unlearn said behaviour would genuinely like better ’ really sure help either direction go help ’ personally never held bias sort drug told ’ acknowledged flaw ’ like work ’ already incredible step forward ’ know go negative bias towards drug ’ actually quite progressive views fentanyl definitely bump road would like help overcome articles tips personal experiences anything else could show guys know unlearning harmful biases specifically around drugs/drug use rs appreciate everything
ChatGPT output on difficult IV/mainline placement. 💉🩸🩹,"Last night I prompted chatgpt for a guide to difficult IV placement and I wanted to share the output I received. The entire chat consisted of several prompts and responses back and fourth and was pretty in-depth, so at the end I prompted for a summarization of our discussion. I’ll share the chatgpt link for anyone that wants to read the full discussion or continue the chat where I left off. 


For context, this was my original prompt:

Respond as a vascular specialist with factual and accurate information. I need to pass a physical test placing an IV on an anatomically accurate human dummy. The test dummy will have a fully functional circulatory system replicating the human body. During the test, I will be required to insert the IV into any vein successfully and inject a saline solution into the bloodstream. How can I insure the best placement in the event I’m faced with obstruction of primary IV placement locations?


ChatGPTs summarization of full chat:


Enhancing Vein Visibility for Venipuncture or IV Placement:

Step 1: Prepare the Environment:

Ensure adequate lighting in the room.
Darken the room if possible for better vein visualization.
Gather necessary equipment: tourniquets, warm compresses, a flashlight (if available), and a suitable vein-finding device (if accessible).

Step 2: Patient Preparation:

Encourage the patient to hydrate before the procedure.
Ask the patient to wear loose-fitting clothing that allows easy access to the intended puncture site.

Step 3: Assessment:

Assess the patient's skin for suitable veins.
Locate potential vein sites through visual inspection and palpation.
Consider alternate sites, especially in the presence of scar tissue.

Step 4: Tourniquet Application:

Apply a tourniquet proximal to the intended puncture site to help distend the veins. Use caution to avoid excessive pressure.

Step 5: Warm Compress:

Apply a warm, moist compress to the intended puncture site for several minutes to dilate the veins and increase visibility.

Step 6: Transillumination (with Flashlight):

In a darkened room, position a flashlight on one side of the limb, shining it through the skin toward the other side.
Look for shadows that may indicate vein locations.
Transillumination can help enhance vein visibility in emergency situations.

Step 7: Vein Palpation:

Gently feel the skin's surface for the presence of veins.
Veins may feel firmer and more resilient compared to surrounding tissue.
Follow the path of the vein to select a suitable location for venipuncture.

Step 8: Patient Positioning:

Consider positioning the patient's limb to utilize gravity, such as hanging the arm down or elevating the leg, to encourage blood flow to the area and make veins more prominent.

Step 9: Use of Vein Contrast Agents (if available):

If vein contrast agents or imaging agents are available and appropriate, consider their use to enhance vein visibility.

Step 10: Safer Alternative Veins to the Arms:

When veins in the arms are inaccessible or compromised, consider alternative veins in the legs.
Potential leg veins include the great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein, anterior tibial vein, posterior tibial vein, popliteal vein, and peroneal vein.
Assess leg veins for suitability based on the patient's anatomy and condition.

Step 11: Proceed with Venipuncture or IV Placement:

Once a suitable vein is identified, proceed with the venipuncture or IV placement using proper aseptic technique and following established medical procedures.

Step 12: Monitoring:

Continuously monitor the IV site for any signs of complications, such as infiltration, phlebitis, or infection.

In emergency situations or when specialized equipment is unavailable, improvisation may be necessary. Always prioritize patient safety and choose the safest and most appropriate approach for the circumstances, considering both vein visibility and patient comfort.

Are traces of fentanyl in almost all powdered drugs?,"Are there traces of fentanyl in almost all powdered drugs? Likely traces that a Dancesafe test cannot see?

I test all of my drugs before using.  I sometimes do ketamine.  I also test MDMA and cocaine for friends.

Dancesafe tests always show negative for fent in the stuff that I test. 

But it is it likely there is still traces amounts within these drugs? 

Also, on with rocks of MDMA, is it likely that one part of the rock could have fentanyl and another part not?

Ketamine harm reduction tool that's working for me.,"Joyous very low dose at home ketamine taken intraorally has been effective for me as a self-administered MAT program.

Forums and organizations for harm reduction-based approaches to moderating use?,"First, my apologies if this question has already been asked and answered.

Recently, I feel like my relationship to why and how I'm using has changed in a way that I'd like to address with the support of other users. I'm concerned enough about this to want to make some active changes. However, I am not yet convinced that I have ""an addict's brain,"" that I am ""powerless,"" or that substance use is somehow a ""(moral) sickness.""

Basically, I think I'm looking for a community that takes a harm reduction-based approach and where I can talk openly about my relationship to substances with the understanding that abstinence need not be the goal for everyone, even those of us who fuck up sometimes. I'm not saying I'm against entertaining the possibility that I might need to abstain from the use of (all or certain) substances. But I imagine that it's quite difficult to really interrogate and reflect critically on one's own relationship to substance use when you're told to know in advance that the answer to every question is ""it's because you're addict.""

Do folks have suggestions such communities, either online forums (Reddit or otherwise) or organizations that sponsor meeting groups (either in-person or virtual would be great)?

IVing high volumes,"Hey everyone, a question perhaps a bit off the beaten path. I’m looking into IVing this certain drug that has a really high volume.

And, before I say which drug, let me just say that I have good reason to want to know this and yes I know it’s got 90 oral bioavailability. It’s pregabalin and I use it to control anxiety, among other things&if I take it orally it takes 2 hours or more to get the needed effect,& I often don’t have 2 hours notice, for anxiety, or any of the other symptoms and I can’t jst take it all day, every day, because it doesn’t work two days in a row as many of u know…
So I’d appreciate if yall’d help me with this🙏🏼

Now the actual question :)

So, as you may know, it requires 300mg or more for an effective dose and as you may not know, (source below…)it dissolves into water at about 107mg/ml if its ph 3.7, and I don’t really know if that’s safe to shoot, so side note, if anyone knows what ph is safe, that’d be great to know. As the ph goes up it’s less soluble, down to about 47mg/ml@ ph of 10. So getting the ph down is critical really I’m just not sure how low it can go if we’re lookin at this from a harm reduction perspective, safety standpoint, and so on.

The other part of the question is with this high volume, (potentially 3-4ml+), there’s only one way I can think of to do it but I’m fishing for suggestions all around. So, I’m thinkin it’s going to require a 3ml syringe, and maybe going to a 30g butterfly cuz I don’t believe there are any 30 gauge 3ml combined needle and syringes please do correct me if Im wrong or if you have any other suggestions that would work. Also, suggestions for how to acquire these are very welcome. I’m in Canada, not sure if I might have any more trouble with that up here, but I wouldnt be surprised. I’m also aware that 3ml could be insufficient if Im unable to bring the ph down enough so I could need a solution for 4ml or more so anyone who knows how I could do that if that’s necessary, I appreciate any input…

Thanks so much for your suggestions!

Non Alcoholic Beer & Tetrabenazine(interaction)?,"Let me be clear:

I have drank Non-Alcoholic beer(Heinken 0.0) recently but take Rx meds Protonix, Lyrica, Valium, Nasacort Spray, Jublia topical but I did ask my doctors that Rx me oral meds:  Protonix(GI), Lyrica(neurologist), Valium(psychiatrist) if Non-alcoholic beer interacts with my meds and they said no known interactions. I drank two Heinken 0.0 two weeks ago and I didn't pass out, didn't black out, didn't end up in an ER room or psych ward. Just had a mild buzz like I smoked a small joint. 

Recently I started Tetrabenazine 12.5 mg for oro-dystonia due to chronic teeth clenching/TMJ issue I got that my neurologist started me on. Unsure if that medicine and Non-Alcoholic beer have any interactions at all.

"New too IV, DOC is meth","Just wondering if there is a harm reduction thread or guide anywhere specifically for meth. Like a very in depth one that covers majority of things. Been shooting meth usually once daily for the last week, did it 5 years ago briefly but a close friend always doctored me. only had one good rush off it since I started shooting again and have had to empty out so many shots because I messed something up. So if you don’t mind leaving some tips or something you wish you knew when you started that would be very appreciated !

Worried I took too much hydrocodone/Tylenol,"Yesterday I got some 7.5/325 hydrocodones from a coworker.  Throughout the day yesterday I took 10.  I got them around 12:30 yesterday, so I took 4 immediately, then another 6 about 4hrs later.  Didn’t take anymore til this morning.  I took 6 this morning, then about 5hrs later I took 6 more.

That’s about 7200mg of Tylenol in 23hrs.

I’m kinda panicked because I didn’t even think about it.  To me, 4000mg a day, so I was just not gonna take any more today, I figured 3250mg yesterday, 4000mg today, but I didn’t think about how much time had passed.

I realized this around 30min after taking the last 6.  I then drank a bunch of water and go made myself puke.  I didn’t see any whole pills come out.  I was thinking to go get activated charcoal on my lunch break.  There was easily about 15hrs between my last dose yesterday and my first dose today.

I'm so grateful for the space harm reduction has in recovery.,"I'm a former user. I don't feel the need to know my exact sobriety date, and every day that I wake up and every night I go to bed, and I did not willingly or knowingly use any substance or outside entity to cover up any pain I was avoiding dealing with that day, I will continue to refer to my use in the past tense. I will always remember it, as it was the day I was free from my abuser, but to dwell on it or keep track has never helped. Working with a harm reduction peer advocate to have a safe space to not feel judged or shamed by my past relapses, and who encouraged me to learn from it instead of feeling like I failed has been a god-send. It has helped me learn to find and create my own tools to utilize to sustain any amount of sobriety. To recognize that any use, including marijuana, was what got me into the kind of mental headspace that I not only did not like to live in, but attracted the type of people that furthered my continued use. I'm not saying some of those in recovery cannot safely use marijuana, as a way to stay clean...for me, I finally recognize that in the past my inability to acknowledge leaving wiggle room in my mind to use medicinally led to recreational use, which for me, is a mentality that lead back to alcohol and eventually stimulants. There is no wiggle room or an iota of my being that wishes to ever touch any of them again. It's like I finally touched the hot stove enough to learn my lesson. If you're not in this place I'm in, I understand, it's been a long journey here. I'm so glad I finally did though. I'm not done, I realize a journey of healing is life long, and I'm ready to continue down it.

Be kind to yourself, be kind to others, and if ever you stumble on your path, don't beat yourself up, just notice that you stumbled, and if you have the ability that day, look at why you stumbled, and how to prevent it next time.

Testing is not an Effective Method to Prevent Harm to the Majority of Users,"EDIT: I am not suggesting we stop testing drugs, I am saying it is not an effective to stop opiate users from taking what they get. Safer supply is a revolutionary and simple alternative. Instead of buying potentially tainted street drugs, doctors supply a pharmaceutically pure alternative of a lower risk opiate at the same dose to prevent withdrawal. I am anything but fatalistic, but the reality of the situation requires we work together to get creative.  


I wanted to make a post about this because I'm kind of shocked how often people are bringing up testing drugs as an effective way to reduce harm. It may be different in places that have a supply of clean opiates. However, what I've witnessed working at a safe injection site is that *fentanyl is the drug of choice for opiate users currently* because it is widely available and potent. There are variations like carfentanil that are much more potent, but the average daily opiate user has a high enough tolerance to survive it. ***The sad reality is that the drug we are testing for is the one being sought out.*** Opiate users on the street that need a fix *will not take the time to test what they have* because it's a time consuming way to discover they have been ripped off.

I know peoples hearts are in the right place, but it has become impractical with the current state of things.

"Went through around 15 needles, could not register veins, I forget to loosen the tie upon registering and pushing in, all the good veins are numb and l like flat tires","I had a binge, it was a bad move. I kept not getting a rush.

I've only been injecting for less than a week and just cant seem to register.

Now my arms are screwed. I know I have to take a break from IV, I feel like I just don't know how to do it right except for the easy veins (fat one on top of forearm & bulging inner crook.)

Ive tried every visible, and feelable vein on my arm and they're all screwed.

How long will it be until they heal? I'm using 30G 0.3 ml 8mm syringes. How do I stop making holes in my veins, missing, and ruining the shot after its registered? Should I be using a shorter syringe? I feel like most people use the 8mm one.

I'm stuck with only 0.3ml 8ml sharps,"I usually IV my DOC in 1ml sharps.

All I have is 0.3ml 8m sharps.

I used room temp water, heated pulled it through cotton, and it quickly recrystallized.

When I run sink's hottest water over it, it all dissolves and unclogs.

This is 92% pure RC HCL salt with paperwork from a legal lab, I don't need to use cotton but I just do so in case there's other particulate doohickys.

Anyhow, I'm not new to what we learn about solubility but I am new to IV'ing.

What if there's an undissolved (due to crashing out of solution mid-shot) piece that goes into my vein that I cant see?

I have the rig in a hot water bath and it seems fine, a little milky maybe.

Is this unsafe?

tl:dr purity not the issue, the issue is that the solvent is in such small amount that more constant heat than usual is needed to dissolve, and it seems to be a saturated solution that recrystallizes when left at room temp for too long.

Use of supplements when drinking as a method of alcohol harm reduction,"Hi Guys, 

I understand that eliminating alcohol is the healthiest option, but as someone who still wants to enjoy a drunken night out every now and again, I was looking at some supplements that will reduce some of the harmful effects of drinking alcohol, and potentially reduce hangover effects as well. I know there is not way to eliminate all negative effects of alcohol, but my thought is if I can take something to at least offset some of them, I might as well!

I did some research on these supplements and am thinking of the following: 

Glutathione before and after

NAC before

Vitamin C before and after

Vitamin B1 before, during and after

Also: 

Zinc/Magnesium before bed

Coconut water before bed and morning after

My concern is that a lot of these supplements may do the same thing (basically antioxidants/reduce the effects/regulate the eliminate of acetaldehyde). Is having all the supplements overkill or potentially dangerous? Would it be best to take just one or too?

Does anyone have any advice or experience with these supplements? Am I on the right path? Should I remove or add anything?

"I have a question about the ""benzo dope"" that's been going around.","So, my pet goldfish has run into this quite a bit lately. I had been hearing reports of benzo dope for a couple of years now but I thought it was just a misnomer and that it was cut with some random sedative rather than a full on benzodiazepine. However, as my pet goldfish has done this stuff multiple times now, they can verifiably say that it truly feels like there are actual benzos mixed in with the heroin and/or fentanyl. The part that confuses me though is that I had always thought that benzodiazepines had a very very low water solubility, which would mean that if this stuff has actual classical benzos in it, you technically shouldn't be able to effectively insufflate it or that it wouldn't dissolve into the small amounts of water that would be used for IV use. So my question is, does anyone know what benzos they're putting in this stuff? I'm assuming it would be an RC along the lines of clonazolam or etizolam, but even those have very low water solubility. I'm just concerned since my pet goldfish isn't totally sure about what they're putting into their body and they're becoming scared of having to go through benzo withdrawal on top of the normal dope sickness since my goldfish has had to do it frequently lately as that's really all that's available in my city all of a sudden. Either that or tranq and that stuff really scares my goldfish.

"Dosed way too high, when should I be worried?","So I did a bad. Took some 2cb and 3mmc to have a personal celebration of something hard I did. I didn't intend to redose, but high on 3mmc it seemed a good idea. Probably ended up around 400-500mg. Then I thought it was a good idea though try add 4mmc. It was kinda weak so I dosed a little high, and then kept adding because I wasn't feeling much. Probably up to/maybe even over 1g over just a few hours. I did not sleep that night and got intensely nauseous during the day. Still am a day after, my sides hurt a little. Are there any warning signs I should watch for? Any tips to help speed up recovery?

This deffo was a bad idea and has scared me away of using any cathinones for a long while. I severely underestimated the compulsive redosing, especially as I have not had this issue at parties.

Edit:
I just checked the weights of the bags before and after. I am shocked. I knew it was around 500mg 3m. But when I weighed the 4m it was 2.7g lighter. I spilled some here and there, but wow.

Swapping Codeine for Vaporised Cannabis: Good idea?,"Hello all :)

Currently on an Opioid relapse after not having touched any for over a year (first time was Codeine about 2 years ago, second time was Tramadol over a year ago, and this time it's Codeine again). I'm really worried about the path I'm going down, but I've been given a cannabis vape pen, and was wondering if using the vape instead of the Codeine is a good idea in an effort to say goodbye to Opioids? This relapse feels like it has everything to do with worsening depression, and the need to be creative for my chosen career. I feel my incredible job slipping away.

Just wondering if the Cannabis could still give me some of that ""don't be sad"", ""get-up-and-go"" and ""go make something creative"" feeling that Codeine does? Essentially, I want to swap one for the other, with the current medication being dangerous, and the alternative (weed) being less so.",8,3,2023-07-11 13:43:36,swapping codeine vaporised cannabis good idea hello currently opioid relapse touched year first time codeine 2 years ago second time tramadol year ago time 's codeine 'm really worried path 'm going 've given cannabis vape pen wondering using vape instead codeine good idea effort say goodbye opioids relapse feels like everything worsening depression need creative chosen career feel incredible job slipping away wondering cannabis could still give `` n't sad '' `` get-up-and-go '' `` go make something creative '' feeling codeine essentially want swap one current medication dangerous alternative weed less

"120bpm, low blood pressure, blurred vision, cant keep eyes straight or focused fingers uncoordinated, sweating, soreness in the crook of my left arm, vomiting from stim/opiate/benzo combo","**update:**

I realized I may have accidentally consumed a small amount of methanol that night as it was absorbed into some seeds that I forgot to rinse out. even after the other substances started wearing off, the vision symptoms continued. From there I tried to remedy it by drinking half a shot of liqour once an hour to stop the MeOH from metabolizing into formate. The vision symptoms and vomiting subsided about 4-5 hours later.

\----

consumed:

\- .5mg **lorazepam**,

\- .4-.8oz of poppy seed tea (2.5lbs of weak store bought seed),

\- a lot of compulsively vaped **PPAP** throughout the day.

\- 3 tiny freshly picked poppy heads far earlier (like up to the size of a grape)

Crook of left arm kind of sore, starting to dissapate now, I have a 110-120 bpm, blood pressure feels pretty low.

Vision keeps wanting to fall cross-eyed, it's really hard to type this without losing eye focus

I wasn't able to take full breaths for a while during this too, That's gradually coming back though.

**I'm kind of worried about how difficult it is to not go cross-eyed -** does that symptom mean anything?

I've been regularly vaping an RC called PPAP for the last 4 months. Puts my heart rate between 120-150, sometimes, and its stressed my heart out. I've had the left arm more sore before too but it was more so than now. I've also had an experience after using too much where I felt a weird pulsing pain in the back of my head. I also have a few very old concussions that don't bother me.

\-----

Is this just the poppy seeds maybe having a higher concetration in this batch? Is there any way this is a pre-anyeurism or something going on with cardiac?

Need. help understanding if this is something going to the hospital for, or if I'm just nodding and sleep deprived

**THIS IS A COPY OF THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT POST FOR THE FREE PDF**

This was always the plan. My book, all 638 pages of *The Drug Users Bible,* is now FREE to download as a PDF. To get your copy… please read this: ===>

**1. WHAT IS IT?**  

In a nutshell, it’s a harm reduction reference tome. From Amazon:

“*Over a 12 year period the author of this book self-administered over 180 psychoactive substances; both chemicals and plants. For each he recorded the life-sensitive safety data, including the anticipated onset times, the common threshold doses, the routes of administration, and the expected duration of the experience. In addition, for every compound he also produced a trip report, detailing the qualitative experience itself. This delivered another invaluable insight, enabling, for example, an objective assessment of the extent of any loss of judgement and self-control*.”

**2. WHY IS IT NOW FREE?**  

It was written to make a difference: to get critical harm reduction and safety data into the hands of as many people as possible, whatever their drug of choice.

The starting point was that I’m old and I like to read my books on paper. Hence, I wrote it for paper and always visualised it as the real physical book it became. That’s how it has always been sold, and still is. I know it has already helped a significant number.

HOWEVER, on paper it does cost $$$. I can’t change that, but what I can do, finally, is provide it for free as a PDF. So if you are happy with a non-paper version, and not too frustrated with this sort of navigation, you can now download it without charge.

You can have it on your phone, your PC, your laptop, or anywhere else you want it.

**3. HOW YOU CAN HELP OTHERS**  

It really is vital that we make harm reduction information ubiquitous within our community. It really is ignorance that kills so many of us. We really really must do our best as a community to make safety practices second nature, and get the essential data to everyone who needs it.

You can help with this project. Please do help.

If you are able, please download it and re-upload it to wherever is appropriate: to anywhere from which anyone who uses drugs may see it, and be able to download it themselves for free. Or alternatively just share the download link.

Ignorance kills, but I hope that some of you will help to save some of those lives. The portability of a PDF may help to at least put the idea of harm reduction on the agenda where it was previously overlooked.

**4. WHERE CAN I GET IT?**  

See above. As it is a drug book it could be banned by any of the clearnet hosts at any time, so it is probably a good idea to download it sooner rather than later.

**5. FINALLY**  

Thank you for all your help and support with this project over the years. It would not have been possible without you.

Together, let’s try to make a difference. If you have any questions, at all, please don’t hesitate to ask.

Time-release Safe Suggestions - Halp!," 

I need a **tamper-proof, time-release safe** with the ability to **release after** **X** ***weeks or months***, bonus if it also does hours. I'd prefer something heavy and/or with a floor mount that isn't easily un-mountable. Please suggest anything you've used and would recommend!

If you care to read about my current situation:

I just did detox and res, and now I'm going into a PHP. My hope is that my all-consuming, falsely perceived need to compulsively use drugs will subside a little during the 8-week PHP, which I know is a lot to ask, but more importantly I hope that I'll gain some new skills to use in response to my triggers and compulsive urges. For now, not having my DOC in the house led me to going out cop immediately, so I figure that the best thing is to have drugs in the house with an external control on my ability to use them. It's a good ole pause, ya know?

**PLEASE DON'T JUST TELL ME TO GET RID OF WHATEVER DRUGS I MAY HAVE.** That will not be helpful. My feinding ""friend"" already consumed my entire stash while I was in detox and rehab (that bitch owes me $2k muttermuttercomplain), and when I got home and found all my shit gone, I paced around for about an hour and then went to cop, even though I wasn't planning to get high. That was the day before yesterday and I still haven't used. Applaud me, dammit lol. So yah, being completely without my DOCs makes my stomach turn, but I really want to continue this stretch of sobriety and I don't trust myself white-knucking through a bad day. Working towards being able to have have drugs around without having a panic attack. It's a process.

I know this might come up - **sober living isn't an option right now**, but I'm open to the possibility that I may need that if my current plan doesn't work. I'd actually love to live in a sober house, but I also have two cats with special needs and I'm dead-set on keeping them with me. Siiiigh... someone might be inclined to talk shit about how the cats would be better with someone else - yahyahyah I'm an addict, but pinky swear I'm a good kitty mama :) I put their needs before mine, and everyone in my life agrees that I'm the best caregiver for them. I stock the fuck up on food, treats, toys, litter, meds, scratchers, and everything their kitty hearts desire, and I've never once had to make a decision between them and drugs in any capacity. They see the vet more often than I see the doctor. I also just dropped a few hundred $$ on a talking button kit that I researched tf out of, and I'm currently training them both to use it so they can have their wants and needs heard and met more constantly.",4,3,2023-06-17 20:23:53,time-release safe suggestions halp need tamper-proof time-release safe ability release x weeks months bonus also hours 'd prefer something heavy and/or floor mount n't easily un-mountable please suggest anything 've used would recommend care read current situation detox res 'm going php hope all-consuming falsely perceived need compulsively use drugs subside little 8-week php know lot ask importantly hope 'll gain new skills use response triggers compulsive urges doc house led going cop immediately figure best thing drugs house external control ability use 's good ole pause ya know please n't tell get rid whatever drugs may helpful feinding `` friend '' already consumed entire stash detox rehab bitch owes 2k muttermuttercomplain got home found shit gone paced around hour went cop even though n't planning get high day yesterday still n't used applaud dammit lol yah completely without docs makes stomach turn really want continue stretch sobriety n't trust white-knucking bad day working towards able drugs around without panic attack 's process know might come sober living n't option right 'm open possibility may need current plan n't work 'd actually love live sober house also two cats special needs 'm dead-set keeping siiiigh ... someone might inclined talk shit cats would better someone else yahyahyah 'm addict pinky swear 'm good kitty mama put needs mine everyone life agrees 'm best caregiver stock fuck food treats toys litter meds scratchers everything kitty hearts desire 've never make decision drugs capacity see vet often see doctor also dropped hundred talking button kit researched tf 'm currently training use wants needs heard met constantly

Healthy dating?,"Hey all-
I've been dating someone on and off for about 10 years. We both use substances and our relationship goes in and out depending on our use. We have each been using or drinking for about 30 years and have been in and out of abstinence-based recovery over those years. Discovering harm reduction language a few years back was transformational for me.

I'm currently in a deep healing sort of phase, I'm on Naltrexone and Gabapentin and in therapy and going to the gym and meditating and really just doing a bunch of work on addressing why I use substances so that I don't feel like I need to consume or change the way I feel every single day. I'm self-employed and self-sufficient and I'm also a single parent. I have a place to live, and a car and my own business. I'm not rich, but I can take care of my life and my kid.

My person lives a couple hours away and doesn't have a car or a job. They can't transition between worlds the way I've been able to and so they are kind of stuck in that hamster wheel cycle of being in addiction and having poor mental health and not having a stable place to live. I see them taking some strides towards healing; dental stuff, trying to pay off tickets to get their driver's license back etc. They started MAT but I'm not sure if they are taking the medication every day and they don't seem to be really committed to a holistic approach like I am. But I don't want to be like their parent and also who am I to say that my way is the right way for them? 

I love them so much and they feel like family to me, but after 6 months of dating again after a 2 year break, I'm starting to feel burnt out. It's such an imbalance. I have always had more financial security and stability than them and I often feel like I'm their case manager or their parent or... anything but an equal PARTNER. It weighs on them too and they end up acting kind of insecure and jealous. 

Folks who live outside the world of substance use will say that addicts aren't capable of being in relationships but we are. They are just fkn complicated lol. So, I'm here in this subreddit rather than the relationship advice one because I want some advice that's a little bit more compassionate or a little bit more understanding of the fucked up kinds of lives we can live. 

One more thing: I can't imagine myself being in a relationship with somebody who has their shit together. And I just recently realized that , so you better believe im bringing it up to my therapist! But I think it has something to do with seeing myself as an addict first. Curious to know if anyone else has had this experience of, like, feeling like you're still that homeless junkie even when you've left that old life behind.

Thanks in advance!",6,10,2023-05-18 01:31:55,healthy dating hey all- 've dating someone 10 years use substances relationship goes depending use using drinking 30 years abstinence-based recovery years discovering harm reduction language years back transformational 'm currently deep healing sort phase 'm naltrexone gabapentin therapy going gym meditating really bunch work addressing use substances n't feel like need consume change way feel every single day 'm self-employed self-sufficient 'm also single parent place live car business 'm rich take care life kid person lives couple hours away n't car job ca n't transition worlds way 've able kind stuck hamster wheel cycle addiction poor mental health stable place live see taking strides towards healing dental stuff trying pay tickets get driver 's license back etc started mat 'm sure taking medication every day n't seem really committed holistic approach like n't want like parent also say way right way love much feel like family 6 months dating 2 year break 'm starting feel burnt 's imbalance always financial security stability often feel like 'm case manager parent ... anything equal partner weighs end acting kind insecure jealous folks live outside world substance use say addicts n't capable relationships fkn complicated lol 'm subreddit rather relationship advice one want advice 's little bit compassionate little bit understanding fucked kinds lives live one thing ca n't imagine relationship somebody shit together recently realized better believe im bringing therapist think something seeing addict first curious know anyone else experience like feeling like 're still homeless junkie even 've left old life behind thanks advance

An Argument for Drug Decriminalization:,"**TLDR**: **Drug Decriminalization improves the well-being of society because it decreases the amount of people who are incarcerated for drug-related offenses which frees up resources for other social programs. Drug decriminalization also creates more effective rehabilitation programs, saves lives (as proven during US prohibition), and has been proven to work time and time again as seen in the revolutionary Portugal Model.**

As harm reduction has gained traction in recent years, push for drug decriminalization has increased as well. Drug decriminalization refers to the elimination of criminal penalties for drug related crimes, such as possession or drug use. Another aspect of drug decriminalization is a focus on rehabilitation instead of punishment. This is a major reason why people support drug decriminalization. In a decriminalized model, a government treats drug addiction as a public health issue, rather than a criminal one. This has many positive effects on society. Although some people argue that drugs should stay illegal due to potential harms that can occur with drug use, there are many more reasons as to why drug decriminalization should occur and why it is more beneficial than our current model.

First, drug decriminalization would decrease the number of people incarcerated for drug-related offenses. In the US, 1 in 5 people are incarcerated due to a drug-related offense according to the Prison Policy Initiative. It costs a significant amount of money to house these prisoners, money that could otherwise go to other public issues. If drug decriminalization were to occur, it would free up both prison space and resources.

Next, drug decriminalization would create much more effective drug rehabilitation programs. When drug use is criminalized, users are much less likely to seek support out of fear of being arrested or prosecuted. If drugs are decriminalized, that fear would go away, allowing those who wish to seek help to do so without the stress of persecution. Also, funds that would originally go to persecute and imprison drug users could go instead to rehabilitation programs increasing their quality and accessibility.

Another huge advantage of drug decriminalization is the reduction of drug-related deaths. Criminalized drug use leads to a dangerous lack of quality control and regulation of substances. This has been shown historically as well. In the 1920's, prohibition was implemented which made alcohol illegal to manufacture and sell in the US. Although the intentions of this law were noble, the effects were deadly. Due to the unregulated quality of alcohol, people started consuming unsafe and dangerous drinks. By the time prohibition ended, it was estimated that over 13,000 people died due to unsafe alcohol. After prohibition was repealed and quality controlled alcohol was being sold, the amount of alcohol-related deaths dropped drastically. As seen from the failure that was prohibition, it is clear that the regulation of substances leads to societal wellbeing. Alcohol is still being regulated today, which keeps people who choose to drink safe. Drug decriminalization also improves access to harm reduction materials such as clean syringes and overdose prevention medication. When a focus is shifted from punishment to rehabilitation, materials to make drug use safe become much more widely available.

Today, drug decriminalization has been implemented in some communities across the world with incredible results. Portugal has been a model example of the success of drug decriminalization. In the 1990's, Portugal had a massive drug addiction problem. In that decade, almost 1% of the country's population had a heroin addiction. Overdoses and diseases like HIV were widespread, and Portugal's nickname was ""Europe's Drug Supermarket."" Portugal's government first reacted with an iron fist. Strict anti-drug legislation was passed, mass arrests were made, and ten of thousands of people were imprisoned. However, the problem still continued to grow. Clearly, their current system was failing, so Portugal's government tried something radical. They decided to treat addiction as a public health issue, not a criminal one. Portugal recruited doctors, psychiatrists, and specialists in addiction medicine to tackle this problem. Soon their plan shifted from viewing drug users as ""criminals"" who needed to be punished to ""patients"" who needed help. Portugal soon passed the landmark decision to decriminalize all drugs in their country from marijuana to heroin. This was a huge gamble, but it paid off. Although people who are caught possessing or using drugs are still arrested, it is what happens after the arrest that makes this model revolutionary.  Those who are arrested have three days to present themselves to a panel in the Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction which is composed of psychologists, doctors, judges, and social workers. The members of these panels assess each case individually to determine the offender's mental and physical health, and any other issues that may be involved (homelessness, schooling, etc). If there is an issue in one of those areas, the panel reaches out to other agencies to better support the individual and their recovery. Those who have an addiction are put into treatment programs that are subsidized by the government, immediately available, and have the resources to provide high quality care. There are also additional levels of support such as methadone clinics, needle exchange programs, and other harm reduction-related programs. Portugal's model combines decriminalization with rehabilitation which creates an incredibly effective treatment model. But just how effective has this been? The number of heroin users in Portugal has dropped from over 100,000 before decriminalization, to less than 25,000 now. Along with that, the rates of HIV and hepatitis infections have fallen drastically as well. In just a decade after the implementation of the decriminalization laws, the annual number of drug-related deaths was 16 people in the entire country.

Many who oppose decriminalization justify it by saying that it increases rates of drug use. However the statistics show the very opposite. In 2016, the average rate of drug deaths per 100,000 people in Europe was 2.2. However, Portugal has 0.4 drug related deaths per 100,000 people. Portugal has one of Europe's lowest rates of drug use and overdose because of the decriminalization model. Thousands of lives have been saved through the Portugal Model, and Portugal has been at the center of advocacy for drug decriminalization.

In conclusion, it is clear that, although controversial, the implementation of drug decriminalization leads to a greater societal wellbeing. From freeing up resources and keeping people safe, drug decriminalization is a logical and very necessary step towards improving public health and safety of those who choose to use drugs.

A Positive Drug Story - Drug People Are Good People,"I spent the last week on the darknet talking to Dread, the markets and drug vendors: basically asking them to inject harm reduction information at the point of drug purchase. Imagine the potential impact of this in reducing misery and death.

So how did it go? This is my story:

.

# A POSITIVE DRUG STORY

On visiting a doctor and being prescribed medication it is taken for granted that you will be provisioned with the requisite information to proceed in a safe and sensible manner. This will perhaps include the dose, the required frequency of administration, potential side effects, and so on. A small-print sheet with details might also be forthcoming.

With respect to recreational drugs and medicines, this is not the case, despite the myriad of additional risks largely created via prohibition (such as the potential for substance impurity and mis-identification). You are usually on your own, with input limited to whatever ad hoc advice is given by your peers or anything you research for yourself (assuming that you make the effort).

However, if you purchase drugs from the darknet this may no longer be the case. There is now a decent chance that at some point in the process you will be offered free harm reduction information in the form of a PDF copy of my book: *The Drug Users Bible*.

This scenario is developing quickly but consider for a moment the concept; of harm reduction information being provided to consumers at the point of drug purchase. Imagine the potential for injecting safety awareness where and when it matters most. Imagine the impact in terms of mitigating risk and reducing misery.

The unfortunate reality is that there is presently no official engagement from any formal authority. The government patently does not care about the welfare of drug consumers; the mainstream media don’t care; law enforcement agencies don’t care. If there is to be a safety net at this particular juncture, it has to be furnished by the community itself. It has to be provided by ourselves: we all have to look after each other.

This is precisely what is unfolding on the darknet.

**A HISTORY LESSON**

On a much smaller scale this has occurred before. Allow me to paint the picture as it existed in the UK some 10 years ago. This was with respect to a forum (the *UK Chemical Research Forum*) which operated during the legal high years. As described in the book itself:

>*""The sophistication of the market developed equally quickly, with internet forums becoming a hive of often detailed discussion. These communities became increasingly important vehicles, and not only through the dissemination of safety information. They were central in framing vendor reputation, which in turn would positively influence the conduct of suppliers.""*  
>  
>*""An astonishing scenario of market/public self-regulation flourished, no doubt saving many lives, until the Cameron Government introduced the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, under the blinkered stewardship of Theresa Mary May. This free to access source of developing and life critical information, and of self-sustaining consumer protection, was instantly destroyed, with the inevitable tragic consequences.""*

In the UK at least this scenario was real, and it was effective. The main players in the drug eco-system were self-regulating and protecting the consumer, despite the hostility of the usual culprits: the government, the media and law enforcement.

**DREAD, THE DARKNET MARKETS & DRUG VENDORS**

Zoom forward to 2023. *Dread* is the major social media platform on the darknet, and has long picked up the mantle of consumer protection: a place for those who choose to use drugs to learn how to avoid many of the more common pitfalls. It is the equivalent of the UKCRF in the above scenario, but on a massive global scale.

Here it has supported the above initiative from the outset; announcing the launch of the PDF and encouraging the markets to involve themselves.

Established markets, such as Kingdom Market, Incognito Market and Cypher Market, have quickly stepped forward. Drug vendors too have embraced the project, including some of the largest. All are offering links to, or hosting, *The Drug Users Bible*, or making the material available in some form to all visitors and consumers.

All these parties understand the magnitude of the issues, and the importance of education and awareness. It is about people: user and consumer protection. It’s about the safety of real human beings: the well being of the community. It is ultimately about saving lives.

**THE COMMUNITY & THE ECO-SYSTEM**

We thus have a situation in which the community itself is doing for itself what governments refuse to do: self-regulate to voluntarily provide a framework of consumer protection and risk mitigation, inclusive of the free of charge provision of safety data.

This demonstrates again that the biggest problem in the entire scenario, in its widest sense, isn’t users, vendors or facilitators; it is prohibition. It is politicians, law enforcement agencies and the mainstream propagandistic media.

This ultimately, is a hugely positive drug story: but it is the sort of news that you won’t be reading on the front pages of the Daily Mail, the Telegraph or the Sun.

FOOTNOTE: WHAT IS THE DRUG USERS BIBLE?

From Amazon: “*Over a 12 year period the author of this book self-administered over 180 psychoactive substances; both chemicals and plants. For each he recorded the life-sensitive safety data, including the anticipated onset times, the common threshold doses, the routes of administration, and the expected duration of the experience. In addition, for every compound he also produced a trip report, detailing the qualitative experience itself.

I believe I have evidence that the DEA is misleading the public about xylazine being found in fentanyl..,"
I believe the DEA is intentionally misleading the public about xylazine and I believe they are doing this to cover up serious criminal misconduct. Everything I’m going to describe here and on the attached pages can be viewed on my YouTube channel.

My name is David $&@&$&, and I am an alleged fentanyl dealer living in Los Angeles. Last October I was arrested at my home in Hollywood by cops from Ventura. They searched my home and found nothing. Despite this, I was taken to Ventura and booked on two felonies for something they allege happened in April. I posted bail right away and when I got to my first court date I found out the police falsified their report and were claiming to have found 16g of fentanyl in my home at the time of my arrest. My case number out of Ventura is: $@&@$@!!??, and I’ve attached my case information on the following page.

Right after posting bail my girlfriend, Flooze, and I began experiencing a massive amount of police harassment. Everywhere we went, droves of plainclothes police followed us in a seemingly endless fleet of unmarked cars. To make matters worse, we were evicted from our home just a few days after my arrest. We became homeless, which made us even more vulnerable to police harassment. Undercover cops, usually dressed up as homeless people with movie quality makeup started following us everywhere we went, all the time. We soon learned that we were under investigation by a multi agency task force consisting of the DEA, LAPD, and VCSD. And, because they lacked the evidence to prosecute me and/or force me to become an informant, and, because all the normal types of entrapment weren’t working, on November 17 they began planting evidence on me. So, I began filming all of my interactions with them.

I have filmed the police committing many serious crimes. I began publishing videos to my YouTube of police planting evidence, beating me for filming them plant evidence, as well as the endless harassment we still to this day are subjected to. This led to the police stealing many of our devices. They’ve stolen several iPhones, two MacBooks (including the one they tried to plant back on me), and infected our last MacBook with malware over a public wifi network. At the moment I am down to my last iPhone and have been editing videos on it. However, I have nearly a terabyte of video backed up on several formats documenting everything I am telling you.

This leads me to what I believe to be the main reason I believe the DEA is spreading misinformation about xylazine being detected in street drugs. On February 21 I was drugged with xylazine after smoking fentanyl a friend purchased from a known police informant. I started blacking out. My girlfriend said I was acting like I was in “slow motion.” I also experienced severe headaches and abdominal pain. I can assure you that no drug user would ever intentionally take xylazine for recreational purposes. 

The reason I am so sure the police supplied their informant with xylazine is because the night before, on February 20, I documented what I initially believed to be an evidence planting at Universal Station. Some drugs and drug paraphernalia were placed in my path as I made my way to the market to buy some groceries. I took video of the drugs next to some “stolen Pokemon cards” and an afro pic. I knew they were supposed to be “stolen” because my girlfriend had shown me her Citizen app the day before which said that a black male stole Pokemon cards (we’ve found that the police lie on Citizen all the time). I took a quick video and I went to the store. 

When I was on my way back from the store an LAPD patrol car shined their spotlight on me. When I approached the car I told the officers someone had left some fentanyl in front of the station. Rather than investigating this, however, they asked why I was filming them before driving off. When I walked up to where the planted drugs were left before, I was shocked to find that the police had covered the drugs up with a notice to appear from the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office. They were actually taking responsibility for planting drugs there. What I didn’t realize at the time- was this was actually xylazine laced fentanyl. It looks different on foil than fentanyl alone does. In hindsight, I’m sure the police did this because they thought they would successfully drug me and steal my phone that night. They knew that I am a drug addict and that I was in a state of withdrawal at the time. They also knew that I was alone and I’m sure they expected me to take the drugs and be incapacitated, giving them a great opportunity to steal the phone I recorded the video on and destroy the video I had taken.

A few days later I began seeing little bits of white powder all over the metro stations I commute on. We have a dog named Luna, and she has made it much harder for the police to steal from us. On February 24 Luna ingested some of this powder and was knocked out for a few hours. When I realized what they were doing I started being much more careful with her. Undercover police started trying to feed Luna wherever we wanted went in an effort to drug her. On February 25 there was a huge rainstorm in LA. Inside the Hollywood / Vine Station there were piles of white powder I strongly suspect to be xylazine everywhere. When we got on the actual train, an undercover cop dressed as a homeless person had a cart covering a pile of xylazine underneath it. When the train moved the cart moved with it revealing the xylazine on the floor. I looked down each train car and sure enough right where we stand when we ride the train on each car there was an undercover cop with a cart or a mobility scooter which I’m sure were all hiding piles of xylazine. I took samples of the powder which I still have today.",0,38,2023-05-06 13:34:12,believe evidence dea misleading public xylazine found fentanyl .. believe dea intentionally misleading public xylazine believe cover serious criminal misconduct everything ’ going describe attached pages viewed youtube channel name david alleged fentanyl dealer living los angeles last october arrested home hollywood cops ventura searched home found nothing despite taken ventura booked two felonies something allege happened april posted bail right away got first court date found police falsified report claiming found 16g fentanyl home time arrest case number ventura ’ attached case information following page right posting bail girlfriend flooze began experiencing massive amount police harassment everywhere went droves plainclothes police followed us seemingly endless fleet unmarked cars make matters worse evicted home days arrest became homeless made us even vulnerable police harassment undercover cops usually dressed homeless people movie quality makeup started following us everywhere went time soon learned investigation multi agency task force consisting dea lapd vcsd lacked evidence prosecute and/or force become informant normal types entrapment ’ working november 17 began planting evidence began filming interactions filmed police committing many serious crimes began publishing videos youtube police planting evidence beating filming plant evidence well endless harassment still day subjected led police stealing many devices ’ stolen several iphones two macbooks including one tried plant back infected last macbook malware public wifi network moment last iphone editing videos however nearly terabyte video backed several formats documenting everything telling leads believe main reason believe dea spreading misinformation xylazine detected street drugs february 21 drugged xylazine smoking fentanyl friend purchased known police informant started blacking girlfriend said acting like “ slow motion. ” also experienced severe headaches abdominal pain assure drug user would ever intentionally take xylazine recreational purposes reason sure police supplied informant xylazine night february 20 documented initially believed evidence planting universal station drugs drug paraphernalia placed path made way market buy groceries took video drugs next “ stolen pokemon cards ” afro pic knew supposed “ stolen ” girlfriend shown citizen app day said black male stole pokemon cards ’ found police lie citizen time took quick video went store way back store lapd patrol car shined spotlight approached car told officers someone left fentanyl front station rather investigating however asked filming driving walked planted drugs left shocked find police covered drugs notice appear ventura county sheriff ’ office actually taking responsibility planting drugs ’ realize time- actually xylazine laced fentanyl looks different foil fentanyl alone hindsight ’ sure police thought would successfully drug steal phone night knew drug addict state withdrawal time also knew alone ’ sure expected take drugs incapacitated giving great opportunity steal phone recorded video destroy video taken days later began seeing little bits white powder metro stations commute dog named luna made much harder police steal us february 24 luna ingested powder knocked hours realized started much careful undercover police started trying feed luna wherever wanted went effort drug february 25 huge rainstorm la inside hollywood vine station piles white powder strongly suspect xylazine everywhere got actual train undercover cop dressed homeless person cart covering pile xylazine underneath train moved cart moved revealing xylazine floor looked train car sure enough right stand ride train car undercover cop cart mobility scooter ’ sure hiding piles xylazine took samples powder still today

When Prince died in 2016, this author wrote a blog for the Washington Post's ""Post Everything"" newsletter and in it she spoke of stigma and the off-label use of long-term Suboxone for chronic pain. Although all my doctors wanted me to stay on painkillers, Suboxone was the path I took and it changed my life.

In this most recent book on Harm Reduction, I learned of its roots in the HIV epidemic and further back than that, to the UK's national health service prescribing maintenance doses of cocaine and heroin. Crime went down, long-disabled patients returned to work...what's not to like? 

There was alot about naloxone and testing strips in there which makes me wonder if people like the late Michael K Williams would still be alive today if the Harm Reduction movement wasn't a bit further along.

Harm reduction tips for M.AMPH,"Hi everyone! Thank you for allowing me to join this community. I could really, really use some advice for my friend.

SWIM was first prescribed vyvanse at the age of 21, for adult attention deficit disorder, diagnosed by a psychiatrist. For the first few years , she took it as prescribed. Eventually, (going to try to leave out a bunch of irrelevant info) SWIM started abusing it, buying adderall and taking both, dabbling with coke now and then (that habit did not last long though).

As the years went on, SWIM added in RCs such as 3FMP (temporarily due to availability issues) , a few other RC stims, cannot remember the names but none were cathinones.

Anyway, almost 10 years later, now SWIM is regularly using meth. I don't think SWIM realized how much is going in to the body way too often when it is insufflated as the ROA, which is SWIM's ROA of choice for most recreational substances except for pills. 

SWIM is experiencing some effects that she isn't sure if they are from stress (very often they can be) , or if they are complications from snorting mamph every day. She can breath normally through her nostrils, but she is having swelling around her eyes, and is wondering if that is related directly to the insufflation of a hard substance, or is it from stress and the lack of good sleep hygiene that often comes with using mamph. SWIM is also experiencing hair thinning (which I have told her is probably stress) . Among other things.

Anyway , in conclusion, the few questions I am asking on behalf of SWIM are:

1. If insufflation is her preferred ROA, are there any ways to try and help make sure the nostrils can be taken care of to keep them from getting a buildup of substance inside (or other complications)?

2. If she should really stop insufflation as the ROA, but doesn't enjoy smoking, would crushing the substance, using a microdose scoop to fill capsules (would use one of the smallest sizes available) and taking them orally be a safer route for her? 

3. Are there any other tips, experiences, etc. you would like to share that might be helpful?

SWIM ultimately wants to be able to work on cutting back to a more reasonable amount of mamph.

Please be kind, this is my first SWIM post, and I am not the best at wording things.",6,12,2023-05-01 20:24:20,harm reduction tips m.amph hi everyone thank allowing join community could really really use advice friend swim first prescribed vyvanse age 21 adult attention deficit disorder diagnosed psychiatrist first years took prescribed eventually going try leave bunch irrelevant info swim started abusing buying adderall taking dabbling coke habit last long though years went swim added rcs 3fmp temporarily due availability issues rc stims remember names none cathinones anyway almost 10 years later swim regularly using meth n't think swim realized much going body way often insufflated roa swim 's roa choice recreational substances except pills swim experiencing effects n't sure stress often complications snorting mamph every day breath normally nostrils swelling around eyes wondering related directly insufflation hard substance stress lack good sleep hygiene often comes using mamph swim also experiencing hair thinning told probably stress among things anyway conclusion questions asking behalf swim 1. insufflation preferred roa ways try help make sure nostrils taken care keep getting buildup substance inside complications 2. really stop insufflation roa n't enjoy smoking would crushing substance using microdose scoop fill capsules would use one smallest sizes available taking orally safer route 3. tips experiences etc would like share might helpful swim ultimately wants able work cutting back reasonable amount mamph please kind first swim post best wording things
The Drug Users Bible: Download It Free Of Charge Here!,"This was always the plan. My book, all 636 pages of *The Drug Users Bible,* is now FREE to download as a PDF. To get your copy… please read this: ===>

**1. WHAT IS IT?**

In a nutshell, it’s a harm reduction reference tome. From Amazon:

“*Over a 12 year period the author of this book self-administered over 180 psychoactive substances; both chemicals and plants. For each he recorded the life-sensitive safety data, including the anticipated onset times, the common threshold doses, the routes of administration, and the expected duration of the experience. In addition, for every compound he also produced a trip report, detailing the qualitative experience itself. This delivered another invaluable insight, enabling, for example, an objective assessment of the extent of any loss of judgement and self-control*.”

**2. WHY IS IT NOW FREE?**

It was written to make a difference: to get critical ham reduction and safety data into the hands of as many people as possible, whatever their drug of choice.

The starting point was that I’m old and I like to read my books on paper. Hence, I wrote it for paper and always visualised it as the real physical book it became. That’s how it has always been sold, and still is. I know it has already helped a significant number.

HOWEVER, on paper it does cost $$$. I can’t change that, but what I can do, finally, is provide it for free as a PDF. So if you are happy with a non-paper version, and not too frustrated with this sort of navigation, you can now download it without charge.

You can have it on your phone, your PC, your laptop, or anywhere else you want it.

**3. HOW YOU CAN HELP OTHERS**

It really is vital that we make harm reduction information ubiquitous within our community. It really is ignorance that kills so many of us. We really really must do our best as a community to make safety practices second nature, and get the essential data to everyone who needs it.

You can help with this project. Please do help.

If you are able, please download it and re-upload it to wherever is appropriate: to anywhere from which anyone who uses drugs may see it, and be able to download it themselves for free. Or alternatively just share the download link.

Ignorance kills, but I hope that some of you will help to save some of those lives. The portability of a PDF may help to at least put the idea of harm reduction on the agenda where it was previously overlooked.

Oddly specific question regarding Adderall (IR) and a “bit of of a leaky valve.”,"So, about a year ago, I saw the cardiologist, ran some tests and an echocardiogram revealed a bit of a leaky valve. He said it was serious if I don’t knock it off. I think he was referring to namely the excess of alcohol I was drinking, to which I haven’t had a drop now since that day. I’m pretty sure he wasn’t aware I was taking Adderall at the time, either. And I certainly was only taking a professionally, doctor prescribed, moderate to low dose.

Anyway, to my “question” if you want to call it that: 

Since about a year ago or so when I received the news regarding my heart valve, I haven’t drank a drop since then, however, my diet is indescribably horrendous. Just how I like it, that’s the problem. Food’s (particularly that of the junk variety) honestly my one and only true vice, unexpectedly enough. I take a couple of controlled medications but only ever as prescribed. Never abused them, never had a 
 addiction potential toward anything other than alcohol, unless you count Cannabis. Point is, I have access to them, any never have, and never would indulge..

HOWEVER, in the last couple months or so. I did take significantly sizable amounts of Adderall (a recreational amount for the focus and energetic motivation) via snorting and orally. I’d say a good 15 times in the last couple months or so, but again, never one, abused or taken them other than as prescribed.)

So to finally sum up my here essay (my apologizes) I’ve been up for perhaps almost a day and a half or so, and my lovely, sweetheart of fiancée lay fast asleep next to me like a normal person who sleeps insanely tired, and I’d like to know, that is, just your general opinion or assumption regarding if I should be concerned or not? I will stop taking these high, unprescribed doses from here on out, minus the prescribed 20mg (IR) however, do you think if I take one last dose (10mg pill, orally this time) in hopes to make it to late evening before I knock out I’ll be alright, cardiovascular so to speak? What concerns me is that I don’t really take care of my self. I was diagnosed with a “bit of a leaky valve” as the cardiologist worded it, and said it could kill me if I didn’t change my behavior. Again, he was referring essentially to alcohol. And I tried to tell him my diet was shit but he just said “eat your pizza.” The alcohol being his only concern, evidently poor diet being night and day in comparison.

So, I already did 65mg (IR) total, however, 30mg was taken like 18 hours ago or something, and the last time I took any was 10mg, over five hours ago.

Having deprived myself of sleep all day and now, being so tired that I can’t think and keep spacing out, and given the minor leaky valve, and also my previously diagnosed tachycardia and current high blood pressure and heart rate, do you think I caused any more heart damage or worsened the leakage? Again, a total of maybe fifteen times or so, several days apart, each time I indulged. Now, my PRESCRIBED dose is 20mg. Hell, it was 10mg ‘till just recently. 

So, now that you have some information, my questions in summary are:

1. Do you think if I take one last dose (10-15mg or so, orally this time) in hopes to force my self
awake and make it to late evening tonight that I’ll be alright, cardiovascular so to speak? I have chest pains. and tightness now, even, am extremely spaced, exhaustingly wiped, half asleep, but can I ignore my usual chest pains and high blood pressure ‘till just tonight without risking a heart attack or stroke or other serious health implications?

2. Also, tolerance and safety wise, how bad is that when I did indulge on those days, given I’d take up to 60-70mg when my body normally being used to it’s prescribed dose of 10-20mg twice a day

3. Do you think since my echocardiogram from a year ago revealed the aforementioned leaky valve, that I caused any more damage with these handful of binges? Not to mention for most of my 32 years (and particularly worsening in recent years) I was and am consumed with stress, spent a few years (many years ago) drinking between 45-65 alcoholic beverages, thereby developing a shocking  physiological and metabolic tolerance. And last, once again my diet is beyond horrific. Has been my whole life. I’m also oftentimes burning my self out, constantly sleep deprive. I’ve also been an excessive user of cannabis for almost twenty years and equally as severe as my alcoholism, taking countless, gram sized, milky as fuck bong rips on a daily bases, practically coughing my guts out all time

4. Do you think I can sit here, take one last dose of 15mg or so and watch Netflix like the crazily tired, increasingly disoriented and impulsive fool that I am without fear of cardiac arrest or something else deadly or potentially dangerous? I recently invested in a blood pressure cuff and I usually have hypertension stage 1 or 2 and often a concerning heart rate/pulse of 100+, but it fluctuates back to normal with my recently prescribed, seemingly and very fortunately helpful blood pressure medication, Propranolol.

"Hosting my first harm reduction table at a techno show, anyone got any suggestions/tips?","For the record, I've volunteered with a handful of HR groups in the past, and have taken a few seminars and classes, including DanceSafe's. That said, I don't have a ton of experience and I know many in this community have wisdom from encountering many situations/circumstances that I will not have thought of.

&#x200B;

So far I'm planning on providing: earplugs, pedyalite packets, granola bars, condoms and water, paid for by the concert organizers. I'll have 3 or 4 naloxone kits (syringe) on hand, and have been trained on how to use them.  I'll buy some sterile gauze pads and basic first aid supplies just in case, although neither me nor my fellow volunteer are trained in first aid, so it would definitely be more a last resort. I'm also considering getting a few dozen fent testing strips and practicing a few times beforehand so I am confident using them too.

&#x200B;

Also considering bringing my whole cadre of reagent test kits, which could check everything from ketamine to heroin to 2cb to table sugar, but I'm considering that with how long it takes to test one sample (and how inconsistent the lighting may be in that area) it might be wise not to offer that service in the first place. What do you think? I am very experienced with reagent testing and I would love to offer that if it made sense...

&#x200B;

I used to have access to DanceSafe's [info brochures about the various drugs](https://dancesafe.org/product-category/drug-info-cards/), but I don't anymore and I'm not sure I want to spend $150 just to have them on hand for a crowd which more than likely knows about these things already. Is that reasonable? Are there ways of getting these cards or other similar info brochures for free? Or pdfs anywhere that I could download and print into trifolds myself?

&#x200B;

What else am I missing? Anything else you'd like to add, or any tips you could suggest? Any problems or difficult situations I should be prepared for? I know more than likely it will go fine and I am a quite capable human being, but I'd like to prepare for every eventuality.

"Started reading ""Over the Influence"" and finally decided to make a graph of how my use of cannabis has changed","Image 1: the graph, starting from my first experience, with markers to significant periods.  
Image 2: marker key descriptions.  
Image 3: the ""model"" it's based on.  
Image 4: *Over the Influence* by Patt Denning and Jeannie Little.

I spent about 45 minutes setting up the graph, remembering my evolving relationship with cannabis in the last three-and-a-bit years and associating it with the state of my life at the time.

It's helpful to see visually, not only as a reminder that patterns of use/misuse/addiction are closely tied to one's environment, but also to assure myself that those patterns *have* changed and that I'm not where I started.

I live with my mother who is fiercely anti-drugs and our familial relationship has suffered a lot because of the erosion of trust between us and the bias of puritanical dogma that she carries.

We often argue because she feels like I'm still on the route towards self-destruction and that my strategies for harm reduction are pointless, so this graph was my attempt at validating my own efforts, if only for my own benefit. I'm tired of being gaslit that nothing has changed and feeling hopeless about my own potential for improvement.

It's difficult to think about these things and remember your turbulent past (and present), as many of you well know, but laying it all out methodically like this can help you identify the good among the bad.

Conducting Research on getting more people to carry Naloxone,"Hi everyone! I'm a researcher at the University of Nebraska, and my research team is conducting a study on why people use the hashtags (NarcanSavesLives) and/or (NaloxoneSavesLives) on TikTok. We are conducting this study in hopes that we can identify what drives a person to share information about Narcan/Naloxone online and then help develop effective communication to encourage others to carry Narcan/Naloxone.

Currently, we are looking to interview people who post on TikTok using one or both of these hashtags. If anyone here has used these hashtags in content created for TikTok and would be willing to be interviewed, I'd really appreciate it. The participation would include participating in one Zoom interview that would take about 45-60 minutes.

Disclaimer: There are no personal benefits to the study. The study might cause emotional and/or psychological distress because it involves questions about Narcan/Naloxone, a treatment for narcotic overdose. To help minimize risk, the questions for this study are focused on reasons for promoting and communicating about Narcan/Naloxone, rather than focused on asking about the actual use of Narcan/Naloxone itself. In addition, you may refuse to discuss any topic or refuse to answer any individual question that makes you uncomfortable.

If you have any questions or would be willing to participate, please let me know.

Foundational Principles Central to Harm Reduction,"Harm reduction incorporates a spectrum of strategies that includes safer use, managed use, abstinence, meeting people who use drugs “where they’re at,” and addressing conditions of use along with the use itself. Because harm reduction demands that interventions and policies designed to serve people who use drugs reflect specific individual and community needs, there is no universal definition of or formula for implementing harm reduction.

However, [National Harm Reduction Coalition considers the following principles central to harm reduction practice](https://harmreduction.org/about-us/principles-of-harm-reduction/):

1. Accepts, for better or worse, that licit and illicit drug use is part of our world and chooses to work to minimize its harmful effects rather than simply ignore or condemn them

2. Understands drug use as a complex, multi-faceted phenomenon that encompasses a continuum of behaviors from severe use to total abstinence, and acknowledges that some ways of using drugs are clearly safer than others

3. Establishes quality of individual and community life and well-being — not necessarily cessation of all drug use — as the criteria for successful interventions and policies

4. Calls for the non-judgmental, non-coercive provision of services and resources to people who use drugs and the communities in which they live in order to assist them in reducing attendant harm

5. Ensures that people who use drugs and those with a history of drug use routinely have a real voice in the creation of programs and policies designed to serve them

6. Affirms people who use drugs (PWUD) themselves as the primary agents of reducing the harms of their drug use and seeks to empower PWUD to share information and support each other in strategies which meet their actual conditions of use

7. Recognizes that the realities of poverty, class, racism, social isolation, past trauma, sex-based discrimination, and other social inequalities affect both people’s vulnerability to and capacity for effectively dealing with drug-related harm

8. Does not attempt to minimize or ignore the real and tragic harm and danger that can be associated with illicit drug use",25,1,2023-03-10 17:22:06,foundational principles central harm reduction harm reduction incorporates spectrum strategies includes safer use managed use abstinence meeting people use drugs “ ’ ” addressing conditions use along use harm reduction demands interventions policies designed serve people use drugs reflect specific individual community needs universal definition formula implementing harm reduction however national harm reduction coalition considers following principles central harm reduction practice https //harmreduction.org/about-us/principles-of-harm-reduction/ 1. accepts better worse licit illicit drug use part world chooses work minimize harmful effects rather simply ignore condemn 2. understands drug use complex multi-faceted phenomenon encompasses continuum behaviors severe use total abstinence acknowledges ways using drugs clearly safer others 3. establishes quality individual community life well-being — necessarily cessation drug use — criteria successful interventions policies 4. calls non-judgmental non-coercive provision services resources people use drugs communities live order assist reducing attendant harm 5. ensures people use drugs history drug use routinely real voice creation programs policies designed serve 6. affirms people use drugs pwud primary agents reducing harms drug use seeks empower pwud share information support strategies meet actual conditions use 7. recognizes realities poverty class racism social isolation past trauma sex-based discrimination social inequalities affect people ’ vulnerability capacity effectively dealing drug-related harm 8. attempt minimize ignore real tragic harm danger associated illicit drug use

Tranq 101,"As xykazine continues to show up across the U.S., my friends and I put together a [field guide for PWUD and outreach teams](https://www.everywhereproject.org/services-2) to share what we have learned over the past several years in the first US city to experience this. Here is the first part:

**tranq aka xylazine: a field guide**

**What is tranq and why does it matter?**

* Xylazine is an animal tranquilizer.
* Not approved for humans.
* Primary adulterant in Philly dope & is now spreading across the US. 
* In 2021 & 2022, tranq was detected in >90% of dope samples in Philadelphia.
* Trace amounts of Xylazine has also been found in certain cocaine samples in Philadelphia.

**Why does it matter?**

1) Skin and soft tissue infections

2) Complicates Overdose Response & Appearance

3) Withdrawal Management

4) Safety of individuals using

Exposure to tranq causes skin and soft tissue infections.

No matter the route of administration: smoking, snorting, injecting, or boofing individuals can experience tranq wounds.

Injecting:

* Unlike a typical abscess, the wound can occur anywhere on the body and does not need to be at or near the injection site.

Snorting:

* Wounds inside the nose and sinuses. Wounds can also appear on other areas of the body. 

Smoking: 

* Coughing up black stuff. Wounds can also appear on other parts of the body. 

Boofing: 

* Rectal ulcerations. Wounds can also appear on other areas of the body.

&#x200B;

**1) Skin and soft tissue infection**

* These wounds most closely resemble necrotizing fasciitis. 
* Anecdotally, there has been an increase in amputations due to tranq wounds. 
* Depending upon the progression of the wound, healing may take a very long time and require regular wound care and maintenance. 
* There is no research available to discuss what happens internally, via different routes of administration (ROA) i.e. smoking versus snorting.

**2) Complicates Overdose Response & Appearance**

* Individuals may be unresponsive but still breathing. 
* Check in on people.
* It is important to monitor breathing and, if possible, blood oxygen level. 
* If a person does overdose and naloxone is needed, it is important to closely monitor the individual to see when they resume breathing on their own. 
* Due to the sedating effect of xylazine a person may begin breathing again but not alert/awake.

Alters the appearance of an overdose. 

* Individuals may be unresponsive but still breathing. 
* Check in on people.
* It is important to monitor breathing and, if possible, blood oxygen level. 
* If a person does overdose and naloxone is needed, it is important to closely monitor the individual to see when they resume breathing on their own. 
* Due to the sedating effect of xylazine a person may begin breathing again but not alert/awake. 

**3) Withdrawal Management**

Withdrawal Symptoms are different than opioids & require different treatment. Traditional opioid management will not be effective for tranq withdrawal.

Xylazine withdrawal is similar to benzo withdrawal. 

* Agitation
* Irritability
* Anxiety
* Insomnia
* Risk of seizure

Recommended Medication for Tranq withdrawal: 

* Benzodiazepines; Ketamine; Clonodine; Gabapentin; Penobarbital; Dexmedetomidine; Tizanidine

**4) Safety of individuals using**

Tranq causes extreme sedation which creates a vulnerable situation for the user. 

In some instances an individual may experience a blackout. 

Because of the extreme sedation, individuals are at an increased risk of: 

* Sexual Assault
* Robbery

Morphine Sulphate boofing - safe preparation and practice,"I've recently come across some Morphine Sulphate (MS) Extended Release capsules and have been looking into safer methods of consumption than using orally or intravenously . Having done my homework, the internet seems to unanimously agree that boofing is the way to go. A little odd at first, I won't lie, but I'm getting used to it.

When reading up on how to prepare the contents of the capsules (very small bead-like thingys), for boofage, I've come across different instructions for doing so. The most clear and concise post on doing so advised mixing 60mg of of finely crushed MS and 2cl/ml warm water in a spoon and heating it to the point that it bubbles for just a split second then leaving the solution to set for approximately 30-60 minutes before using.

I'm curious as to what people think of this - is the heating necessary or detrimental? Is it important to let it set or does it not matter? Are there any other safety considerations I should be thinking about?

Let me know what y'all think.

Tranq Wound Care 101

**Exposure to tranq causes skin and soft tissue infections.**

No matter the route of administration: smoking, snorting, injecting, or boofing individuals can experience tranq wounds.

**Injecting:**

Unlike a typical abscess, the wound can occur anywhere on the body and does not need to be at or near the injection site.

**Boofing:**

Rectal ulcerations. Wounds can also appear on other areas of the body.

&#x200B;

* What to do:
   * Clean wounds with soap (if available) & clean water, or saline-no soap neededif no soap is available, water helps too!
   * Keep wounds covered
   * Change dressings
   * Try not to leave on for more than 48 hours
   * But definitely change whenever soiled or soaked through.
   * Keep wounds just a little moist to allow dead skin and scabbing to soften & falloff on its own, & new skin to regrow.
   * Keep skin around wound as clean/dry/free from wound drainage as possible.Try using A&D ointment, or a product like vaseline, on the healthy skin around the wound.

What to avoid:

* Do not use abrasive solutions on wounds such as bleach, chemical cleaners, hydrogen peroxide or alcohol. These are all too harsh for healing skin and should not be used regularly to wash a wound (use saline or water and soap).
* Antibiotics only work against certain bacteria at certain doses—if you take random ones/someone else's/only some pills or if you only take part of your prescription, you might kill off only some bacteria, leaving the strongest ones still in your body.DIY a wound wash for under $3 with a bottle of water and some antibiotic soap. Mix 1-2 teaspoons into the water bottle then poke a hole into the top. Use that as a wound wash. Rinse with clean water.

When to go to the ER:You have an open wound…

* AND have fever, sweats, chills, confusion, dizziness, weakness, or fatigue
* With new or increased drainage, a bad smell (like rotting eggs)
* That grows very quickly
* With very bad pain when you move the body part with the wound or cannot move the body part as normal

If your wound has:

* A black layer covering the outside and small areas of white and red within (think large black scabs with small wide spots), the black is necrotic (dead) tissue that needs to be removed.
* Puss draining or inside the wound itself (puss resembles thick, mostly yellow &/or green, fluid with a bad smell- think yogurt or cottage cheese thickness).
* Very deep areas that may show white hard lines (bone) or bone itself or yellow squishy sponge-like areas (fat exposure).
* Small bugs inside of wound.

Questions about weird IV experiences I’ve recently been having,"Hello,
I’ve been using opioids (predominately heroin) off and on for 15 years with most of that being via IV route of administration. I’m a professional licensed phlebotomist and medical assistant (the irony isn’t lost on me) so I know what I’m doing and I know how to do it safely. I even help with harm reduction and safe use education (during periods of sobriety). 
However, in the last year or so I’ve been having weird experiences when using. I almost never get a rush when I hit anymore and I am completely certain that it is neither a tolerance thing or having to do with the quality of the stuff. What typically happens now when I hit is that I’ll still have a faster, stronger onset of action that with other ROAs but nothing that I would call a rush and a lot of the time it’s accompanied by a stinging down my arm as if it is leaking out of certain points in my vein. This now happens with almost every vain. When I first started noticing this, it would happen in some spots but in other places I’d hit I’d still get a rush. And now lately, there are even some veins that I can hit where absolutely nothing happens and if I’m sick at the time I don’t even get well. It’s not like it’s a slower or weaker onset, it’s just nothing and it doesn’t make sense to me because I can see with my own eyes that I was successful and I can also tell by the lack of pain that it wasn’t a miss. In fact, I feel a typical miss a lot more than this. As both a chronic user and someone that’s worked in the medical field, this is all very confusing to me.

Took 750 mg of unknown shit with some ecstasy - irreversible brain damage?,"&#x200B;

I popped three 250 pills very quickly in 4 hours but Idk which interval. Whenever I misjudged that it was past peak I'd pop one, but I defo was not. I'm scared of ending up with dementia and serious brain damage. I dont know what was in the pills, I can tell it was not ecstasy only and it's pretty damn shitty pills. That was two days ago. Like two months ago I also took another super toxic dose of them pills of 500 mg, and only started having random flashes of memory coming back to me fairly recently. I also took that dose very soon after just a 250 mg dose, I think a week or two but cant remember. I am an absolute idiot and cant control impulses when I'm having mental breakdown and fucked myself over, like I cant believe I'm so stupid and actually did that, I know better. I apologise xD

Right now I cant sleep more than a couple of hours, I'm heavily anxious about my health to the point I kinda convinced myself I was having a heart attack, I burst out in tears from everything and cant be happy. Thats not as concerning as issues with memory though, I cant grasp a SINGLE memory, everything is slipping away from me and its like I know what happened but I cant remember a single flash of memory from that moment, if that makes sense. I'm scared of cognitive decline which is a thing I can't judge but considering the dose there's probably quite serious decline.

I know that this dose was highly toxic and will cause some permanent issues. Is there anything I can do or take to detox ASAP, prevent those issues, anything specific I need to ask the doctor to check?

I wrote a list of almost every supplement [r/mdma](https://www.reddit.com/r/mdma/) reddit recommends and will take that ASAP, hopefully today but idk. The list is recommending stuff to take before, during and straight after though so Idk if that will help. I also thought of eating some activating carbon to clear myself out, will that be a good idea? Obviously I will call the doctor but I'm not quite sure how to go around...explaining this...and what help to ask for, since this is the NHS and if you dont push your way through they will NOT give a crap about you.

Some questions about things I'm taking,"Hello, first thing I want to start with is that I am on a prescription for escitalopram, and that I generally go off it about 5-7 days before using a substance that could interact with it. Is this a good range? I know it can vary greatly depending on the specific SSRI.

Second, I was wondering about the addiction potentials for mephedrone and molly, as I have used both and plan to again. I just want to know if I should be careful with frequency in order to not develop any addiction.

Finally, what substances should I be testing for fent? I live in Ontario, Canada, and I didn't bother testing things like LSD tabs or psilocybin mushrooms since I didn't think there was much risk of contamination at all.

Thanks in advance to any responses!",2,2,2023-02-23 03:27:00,questions things 'm taking hello first thing want start prescription escitalopram generally go 5-7 days using substance could interact good range know vary greatly depending specific ssri second wondering addiction potentials mephedrone molly used plan want know careful frequency order develop addiction finally substances testing fent live ontario canada n't bother testing things like lsd tabs psilocybin mushrooms since n't think much risk contamination thanks advance responses
Compartment Syndrome and Wrist Shots,"I'd love an anatomy-heavy answer of anyone can provide one. I have a big ole fatty vein on my dominant hand, and before I heard about compartment syndrome the wrist portion of this vein was in my regular rotation. I'll link a pic in the comments so you can see which one I'm referencing. Actually, same with a couple veins on my non-dominant hand, they're just not as big and nice. 

Anyway, I understand that veins are close to arteries in the wrist, and that's why it's a dangerous place to shoot, but man, I see this thing very clearly originating from a safe(er) spot on my hand (that I also hit, as evident in the pic) why is it all of a sudden dangerous once it crosses the wrist boundary?",1,10,2023-02-22 16:14:57,compartment syndrome wrist shots 'd love anatomy-heavy answer anyone provide one big ole fatty vein dominant hand heard compartment syndrome wrist portion vein regular rotation 'll link pic comments see one 'm referencing actually couple veins non-dominant hand 're big nice anyway understand veins close arteries wrist 's 's dangerous place shoot man see thing clearly originating safe er spot hand also hit evident pic sudden dangerous crosses wrist boundary

Share your experiences (anonymously) and help with research!,"Hi r/harmreduction community!

My name is Bryant Stone, and I am a researcher at Southern Illinois University and the Medical University of South Carolina. I am conducting research to determine the factors that precede substance use disorders and determine how reducing stigma can improve the lives of those who use substances recreationally.

I am posting a call for participants (see below) for the study. We highly value your input and information on your experiences. We are looking for anyone who might have an opinion on the topic. Participation is voluntary, and all participants are entered into a drawing to win one of four $25 Visa eGift Cards.

Thank you all for your consideration, 

Bryant

**Study Title:** Stigmatization & Beliefs about Risk in Substance Use Disorder Study 

Introduction: My name is Bryant Stone. I am a graduate student in the School of Psychological and Behavioral Sciences at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale. I am asking you to participate in my research study.

**Purpose:** I am doing this research study to increase our knowledge of the ways attitudes, beliefs, and stigma affect the perception and experiences of substance use (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, or marijuana) or are related to substance use history. We hope to use this research to work to prevent substance use disorders and to reduce the stigma surrounding having a substance use disorder.

We will explicitly be asking about illegal substance use in this survey. However, your responses are completely anonymous. We provide more information about this anonymity in the informed consent that you can read before starting the survey.

**Benefits:** If you choose to participate in the study, you will be entered into a drawing for a chance to win one of four $25 Visa eGift Cards. You will also be helping efforts aimed to prevent SUDs and improve the way the people treat those with SUDs.

**Eligibility:** Participation is voluntary. There is no penalty for not participating or for withdrawing from the study.

If you choose to participate in the study, it will take approximately 30 minutes of your time. You will answer questions about what substances you use and your attitudes toward substances. The minimum age to participate is 18 years of age (or 19 years of age or older if you are completing the study from Nebraska, United States). There are no other inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Click the following URL to read the informed consent and begin the study:

stomach ache after small coke binge,"Friday night I did a little less than half a gram of coke. For me that was enough to keep me up through the night and a good bit of the morning. It was a great night, no issues, except I started to get a real bad stomach ache in the morning so I went home. Saturday I ate three bananas, two cheeseburgers, I drank plenty of water all night and then all day, I slept several hours during the day and then slept through the night. Now it's Sunday morning, been 24 hours since the stomach ache started, and it's still there. I ate some oatmeal, that seemed to help slightly. It's a very sharp pain, like a period cramp, and seems to originate from the right of my belly button. Only hurts when I sit up, stand up, or walk. When I lay down it's ok. I can't imagine I did enough coke in that one night to actually cause a stomach problem, and I only use around once a month. but I am feeling anxious despite logic telling me it will pass on its own. Any tips to make this go away or what might be the cause? I really don't want to go to the doctor. I'm hoping it will go away once I poop, but I haven't had to poop yet and that also worries me...

Sorry idk if this is appropriate for this sub, lmk if not, but I trust harm reductionists. My harm reductionist friends irl haven't responded to me yet

"Public Health, Criminal Justice, and Drug Policy (Americans 18 and older):","This survey has been approved by the moderators.

Drug regulation currently classified drugs according to different schedules (I through V, each with progressively greater levels of restrictions). The schedule is ultimately decided by the Drug Enforcement Agency (which is housed under the Department of Justice), and is informed by the Food and Drug Administration (which is housed under Health and Human Services). There is currently discussion as to whether including the DEA in the decision is appropriate or not.   
This survey is intended to investigate what you think the relative roles of the DEA and FDA should be in the regulatory process. The project has been reviewed and approved by the Muhlenberg College (Allentown, PA) Institutional Review Board (IRB) to verify that it meets the ethical standards for research as specified by the American Psychological Association.

If you choose to participate, you will read descriptions of the public health and law enforcement approaches to drug regulation (as well as answer 6 comprehension-check questions), provide your opinions on how the FDA (public health approach) and DEA (law enforcement approach) use their regulations to determine level of regulation, and some questions about 'drug scheduling' (i.e., the level of regulation of a novel drug), some general attitudes towards law enforcement, and demographic/background questions. 

To reiterate, most participants take around 15 minutes to complete.  Also, the IRB has only approved us to have participants be Americans over the age of 18 years old.  
If reading about and answering questions about addiction or about the criminal justice system is particularly difficult, we'd recommend that you don't take the survey.

The study can be accessed at: [https://muhlenberg.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_9ZbHGeUj1Uwitr8](https://muhlenberg.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9ZbHGeUj1Uwitr8)

Methadone RAPID Tapering Withdrawal (My Time At The Moment) - |ONOGOING| @ 18ml,"Hey guys,

Names J.

Been a user for years but just decided I'm going to start being active through various subreddits in regards to many experiences and hopefully now I'm out the other end... In turn I want to help whoever I can with also this painful journey that we all can eventually conquer. - I am now sober from EVERYTHING BAR METHADONE, 67 years of weed, 9 months clean.

Daily use was around 500mg of oxy but for years about over a gram of the horrible Charlie brown daily. SMOKED 95% of the time.

I will be starting a YouTube series just overlaying Harm Reduction and Information about each individual drug from unfortunately but now I feel fortunate enough that I have taken every single narcotic and had my problems pretty badly and lengthy with almost all them ESPECIALLY Opiates(Heroin, Oxy etc) and Weed... So without further a do this will be my methadone ongoing journey and updates to hopefully help anyone I can as well as myself.

I know this is probably one of the worst things to go through but I tell you now from being on and off many times for many years LIFE IS BETTER WITHOUT THIS CRAP (OPIATES).

So I decided about a year ago I'm done with this life, to much to live for - plain and simple. I began a subbie script didn't like it. - So I began a Methadone Script JUNE 16th 2022. Went from 30ml to 60ml in a few weeks. (GOT OFF THE WEED HERE TOO JUST STOPPED)

Stayed at 60ml from JUNE 16th 2022 until DECEMBER 30th 2022. - everything fine besides blooming weight gain which was a surprise nothing major tbh I'm 6ft 2"" and always been fairly athletic build. - Readjusted my life to only Methadone and healthy benefits but my brain is constantly running so I have many hobbies - this stuff disinhibited my interests and drive which I hated. - only positive was eating proper meals and away from the reprobates.

(I am family orientated alot now and I am back at the gym. - life is great I'm nearly there)

THE PLAN:

I am quite knowledgeable, I believe I have been blessed with retention off information and interests in literally EVERY KIND OF TOPIC, SUBJECT etc. - So I am using that to my advantage.

DECEMBERR 31st 2022 - JANUARY 12th: -

1. I devised a plan and routine to get off this shit to look to better things.

Ordered lots of supplements from my protein, all in one protein for the nutrients; electrolytes, minerals, multivitamins; Magnesium & Zinc; CLA; BCAA's, NAC's; L-Glutamate; Cod Liver Oil ( all seperate supplements. - Also half a gallon water bottle.

2. I ordered some Kratom from an amazing vendor [thomthom.se](https://thomthom.se) , They have the best highest quality for Europe/UK.- It actually comes as it should not looking the same but it's distinct properties. I got:

Red Maeng Da - 80grams

Green Malay - 100grams

(They even sent some extras about 100grams worth of extras! - Yellow Lebang and White Sumatra.- Thank you so much my guys - Blessed for the personal hand written note to)

3. Porridge and Maple syrup every morning routinely slow burning energy - our bodies sweat like shit and we lose alot of hydration and electrolytes during this process.

4. Gym Membership for 3 months.

5. Coffee

6.Passion flower and Valerian (in case I need to synergies my magnesium at night time if effects are unbearable.

And this is all! (Besides eating often 3/4 meals a day ritualistically - our body screams for real food during this as it's readjusting to life and the deficiencies we get from extended opiate use.

7. TRY TO GET SLEEP! your body needs it! - forcing myself up at 8/9am and doing my day. - so without further a do my progress so far and the pros, cons, sides etc.

(I Hope this can help some people and reassure them)

GOT PAID 23rd JAN: Ordered everything and anything,

IT BEGINS: - DOSAGE EVERY DAY AT NOON | 12:30pm

NIGHT TIME RITUAL: MAGNSIUM, ZINC and that is all.

26th JAN: 60ml - no issues normal

27th JAN: 60ml - Began incorporating my nutrients and magnesium so my body begins it's recuperation

28th JAN: 59ml - Still same

29th JAN: 59ml - Still same - getting everything in my body for a few days prior to this intense taper I am about to commence. -

30th JAN: 59ml - Now I have a few days of nutrients, maggies and whatever else in me I begin sleeping from 11pm to 8am - routine is now underway.

31st JAN: 45ML - Before dose: I feel great amazing today can genuinely feel my body wanting to speed up

1st FEB: 45ML - earlyish night again 12am - if you become tired GET SOME SLEEP, whether it's 2 hours through the day randomly, YOUR BODY NEEDS IT!

&#x200B;

DISCLAIMER: IF YOU COLD TURKEY WE ALL KNOW THE WEEK LONG INSOMNIA THAT PERSUES YOU CANNOT SLEEP FOR A WEEK SO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DAY TIME NAPS AND NIGHT TIME TIREDNESS.

2nd FEB: 45ml - Feel fine, rather than the horrible severe sides all I got is insane sweating, sometimes random chills but mainly insane sweats!! - slept normal 11ish/pm - 8ish/am.

3rd FEB: 40ML - Exact same as above. - no psychological issues/irritability or usual insane heart pounding and struggle to breath etc that is non existent!

4th FEB: 30ml - Exact same as the above, sweats are now dripping mind but I am fine!

5th FEB: 30ml - \^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^

6th FEB: 28ml - EXACT SAME AGAIN! get on - sweating I am a literal never ending waterfall right now but non of the usual sides again ( I am confused.) - DAYTIME NAP ALL OF A SUDDEN for 2 hours then back to bed at 12am - 9am

TODAY | 7th FEB: 18ml - I am dripping guys today god damn... I have smalls weat glands but this is insane how much I am dripping in sweat. - overall I feel actually great! Besides sweats and chills: No cons to report no bad stomach / GI or anything at all... I can feel my stomach is speeding up mind, lil cramp but i drink a havy coffee every morning.

&#x200B;

5pm today: Going to the gym to reincorporate muscle gain and exercise. nothing intense just light weight high rep and physio  with some light cardio )all rounder session)

Plan is to rapidly taper more so by the 10th FEB I want to be at 5ml. - I know what to expect but I need this shit out my life, everything else is perfect now just these liquid handcuffs that needs to go.

I will update as I go but honestly compared to the cold turkeys I have done and now I realised over the years I've put so much strain on my body it was quite dangerous. DO NOT COLD TURKEY, it does your body more harm than good.

&#x200B;

KRATOM: you may be wondering why haven't I taken it? Well methadone is actually an opiate blocker so this would be no use at all. - until I am say 2/3 days clear of methadone it will do wonders then - maybe even at a few ML a day it may work? But I will update than accordingly when the time comes.

&#x200B;

Daily updates to come: ASK anything at all! I am here to help and thankfully a fountain of knowledge with this crap and the effects it causes. -

I am here to help as well - if anyone needs someone to talk to then I can fire my discord over, we are all in this together - don't feel ashamed feel proud of yourself.

Cheers guys - also if anyone wants me to go into more depth I will wherever is asked.

&#x200B;

Take it easy.

I have a little bag of crystal meth. when should I start panicking and take some to reverse the respiratory depression? or is it all in my head? no it can't be, and no I'm not going to the hospital again I just got back from the fucking hospital

Harm reduction for behavioral/process addictions?,"Hi,

I am aware of harm reduction and find the idea inspiring. Can it be applied to non-substance addictions like gambling, internet, porn etc? 

Does anyone have experience of this or have any guidance to offer? Or is harm reduction more for substances?

I am struggling with problematic porn use. I have found maintaining 'sobriety' extremely hard over the past 6 years. Hence, I am looking to take an approach that 'meets me where I am' and encourages small changes, reducing harms etc. 

Hope this is ok to post here

Newbie Heroin IV Questions,"1) I am using BD Insulin Syringe (Ultrafine) and always have issues with the plunger being hard to move when there is liquid in the barrel and only can move it unless there is a great amount of force. I think BD plungers don’t have much lubrication. I have tried several batches and all the same thing. What can I do to fix this without being unhygienic? Is there any techniques or anything I can do?

2) I always turn the syringe upside down and flick the syringe then press plunger all the way till liquid squirts out the needle tip to get rid of air bubbles. But after can I pull the plunger back a tiny bit to create a air gap? If doing so will this make blood plume into the barrel automatically once I hit the vein?

3) When feeling for arm crook veins how can I tell the depth of the vein? If it’s superficial or not? I have a hard time knowing how deep the vein is and how much of the needle to put in etc.",3,13,2023-01-17 06:09:33,newbie heroin iv questions 1 using bd insulin syringe ultrafine always issues plunger hard move liquid barrel move unless great amount force think bd plungers ’ much lubrication tried several batches thing fix without unhygienic techniques anything 2 always turn syringe upside flick syringe press plunger way till liquid squirts needle tip get rid air bubbles pull plunger back tiny bit create air gap make blood plume barrel automatically hit vein 3 feeling arm crook veins tell depth vein ’ superficial hard time knowing deep vein much needle put etc

Certain Experience With Syringe Making Me Not Able To Insert Needle?,"I am new to IV and always been iffy with needles but I have a couple successful registers. I have some experiences that making me get cold feet now so I have a couple questions.

1) There has been a couple times where I find it hard for the needle to penetrate my arm crook at a certain area where there is very thick elastic skin and fat. The needle does not want to pierce the skin. It will kind of hurt and bounce the needle back. I always use new needles too. Anyone experience this and is there a certain technique to make needle pierce easier for certain areas?

2) I am using BD syringes and when I make the syringe air tight by getting rid all of the air it is hard to pull the plunger. The plunger will not budge when using my index and middle finger to pull. Has anyone experience this and what to do in this case cause the plunger is just so hard to pull? 

3) I have never tried injecting at different areas beside the arm crook. I want to try above the arm crook towards the bicep. But this part you can feel muscle. Will it be harder to pierce and will I hit the muscle?

Or my maintenance dose of methadone(60mg) is making my tolerance up and dont let me get high even in a triple dose? Lyrica I take it to potenciate the opioids effects but it seems it do nothing now.

Ideas for OPS,"Hi. I have recently took over managing an overdose prevention site. It’s been running for nearly a decade but was total chaos when I took over, apparently this has been a common theme.

We have a 14 person capacity limit and the atmosphere is more “homey” not clinic like. I want to ensure the space functions as best as it can while also providing a safe and comfortable atmosphere.

We are extremely low barrier and due to this we often deal with violence, theft, screaming/yelling, and threats to staff. A workers car was vandalized by a person accessing the site recently. We DO NOT ever call the police unless there is a major threat. 

I’m looking for suggestions on how I can run a space, while remaining low barrier so all the folks accessing it feel safe and enjoy being there enough that they don’t want any issues there.

I’ve worked in harm reduction for years and know we won’t be free of these things but I want to at least make small improvements for the betterment of the participants.",10,4,2023-01-04 07:21:45,ideas ops hi recently took managing overdose prevention site ’ running nearly decade total chaos took apparently common theme 14 person capacity limit atmosphere “ homey ” clinic like want ensure space functions best also providing safe comfortable atmosphere extremely low barrier due often deal violence theft screaming/yelling threats staff workers car vandalized person accessing site recently ever call police unless major threat ’ looking suggestions run space remaining low barrier folks accessing feel safe enjoy enough ’ want issues ’ worked harm reduction years know ’ free things want least make small improvements betterment participants

Importance of Water Volume for Fent Test?,I'd really like to be able to use the product I'm testing. Doing so would require much less water than is prescribed for the fent test.

Is anyone aware of any HRKs geared towards a more inexperienced crowd? Like a kit we could give our kids like our parents gave us condoms?,"Not for encouragement but safety. If my kid is trying to hide stuff from me then safety is no longer her primary concern. And i want her to know that her safety is my number one concern on this topic. 

But all the HRKs I see really seem to be geared to someone who already has a habit or at least the experience necessary to acquire one. 

Is there anything out there for parents who just want their kids to be intelligent and informed about drugs and drug use and ready to be safe about it should they make the decision to experiment? 

And where TF *is* that line between encouragement and safety anyway?

I wonder also as I watch the newsgroups that relate to testing and all the issues, uncertainty, and problems there -- is there even an affordable/simple test for fent (for instance). Are the tools even a available for what i envision?

I realize that communication between parent and child is key here but in this post i am specifically interested in finding the tools to put the right kit together. 

I'm kind of thinking a kit for parents who don't stigmatize recreational drug use and/or aren't under any illusions their little angel &amp; her friends won't go looking for an 8-ball some weekend. 

I would appreciate any info or resources in this vein.

Proposed supplement stack for cognitive recovery from drug abuse,"This post discusses a proposed supplement stack designed for people who have struggled with chronic/historic drug abuse that has resulted in cognitive deficits. The stack includes a range of nutrients and compounds that may support brain health, function, and protection from *oxidative stress* - the latter of which I would argue to be the main contributing factor of negative health outcomes from drug abuse.

For context, oxidative stress is a physiological state characterized by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to effectively neutralize or eliminate them. ROS are highly reactive molecules that are produced as a byproduct of normal cellular metabolism, but they can also be generated in response to various environmental insults, including exposure to toxins, radiation and various psychoactive substances. When the body's antioxidant defenses are overwhelmed and unable to effectively scavenge ROS, oxidative stress can occur, leading to damage to cellular proteins, lipids, and DNA - all throughout the body and brain.

The perpetual use of psychoactive drugs has been associated with an increased risk of oxidative stress and related negative health outcomes. Many drugs of abuse, including alcohol and stimulants, have been shown to stimulate the production of ROS or impair the body's antioxidant defenses, leading to an increased risk of oxidative stress. Additionally, drug abuse can alter the expression and activity of enzymes involved in antioxidant defense, further exacerbating the oxidative stress response. Extended exposure to oxidative stress has been shown to lead to a variety of mental ailments, such as anxiety, depression, and psychosis, as well as other cognitive deficits. These deficits include impaired memory and attention, and are caused by the direct damage of brain cells and changes in the brain's normal functioning.

If you or a loved one have experienced cognitive and/or physiological deficits as a result of drug abuse, seeking professional medical treatment should always be the top priority. In addition to seeking professional help, individuals may also consider incorporating supplements into their regimen to support brain health and potentially repair any damage caused by their drug abuse. In this post, we will examine a number of these supplements, including:

**N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)**: NAC is a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione, which helps protect the brain from oxidative stress. It may also have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. NAC may also support healthy liver function and reverse liver damage. [Link to purchase](https://a.co/d/0t0uocu)

**Bioactive (Methyl) B complex**: B-vitamins are essential for brain health and function. Deficiencies in these vitamins can lead to cognitive impairment and mood disturbances. It’s important to use bioactive/coenzymated B vitamins, as the body has a much easier time absorbing and utilizing them. [Link to purchase](https://a.co/d/4S70rRz)

**Omega-3 fatty acids**: These essential fatty acids may help support brain function and may potentially have neuroprotective effects. They also possess anti-inflammatory properties and have been found to be effective in reducing the severity of withdrawal symptoms in individuals with substance abuse disorders Particularly EPA and DHA are found to be the most helpful. [Link to purchase](https://a.co/d/3f4Frj0)

**Magnesium glycinate/citrate**: This essential mineral is important for brain health and function. Magnesium is involved in a number of important processes in the body, including nerve and muscle function, energy production, and DNA synthesis. It is also thought to play a role in regulating brain function and improving cognitive performance. Do not use magnesium oxide as the body cannot properly absorb it. [Link to purchase](https://a.co/d/7sspbzR)

**Vitamin C**: Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant which helps to protect against oxidative stress and damage caused by drug abuse. It plays a role in a number of physiological functions, including the synthesis of collagen and norepinephrine, as well as the maintenance of healthy skin, blood vessels, and bones. [Link to purchase](https://a.co/d/0eGbLuF)

**Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR)**: ALCAR is an amino acid that may help support brain function and have neuroprotective effects. It is thought to work by increasing the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in memory and learning. Evidence has shown ALCAR to be effective in reducing the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. [Link to purchase](https://a.co/d/0jaBp6C )

**Sodium-R-Lipoate**: This is a form of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid, which has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and may help to improve cognitive function in individuals with cognitive decline. In particular, it may help to reduce drug-induced oxidative stress in the brain, which can lead to the death of brain cells and contribute to cognitive decline. [Link to purchase](https://a.co/d/he40PGE)

**CDP-Choline (Citicoline)**: Citicoline is an endogenous (naturally occurring in the body) compound that is involved in the synthesis of phospholipids, which are essential for the proper functioning of cell membranes. It is believed to enhance brain function and improve cognitive performance by increasing the availability of acetylcholine, which is involved in learning and memory. [Link to purchase](https://a.co/d/bRB3wcg)

**Lions Mane Mushroom**: This supplement can help regrow nerves in the brain and repair damage from drug abuse. It is also believed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may help with cognitive function. Some people also happen to use it as a replacement for ADHD meds. [Link to purchase (added ginkgo biloba)](https://a.co/d/1C1n8xu)

**Disclaimer:**

I would just like to mention that I am NOT a medical doctor. Rather, I have studied holistic medicine extensively for several years and have personally experimented with each of the supplements listed (as well as many others), yeilding positive results. The supplements have been listed based on my personal ranking of importance and success, and the links provided are what I’ve found to be the most cost-effective products. Many of these supplements may also work in conjunction with one another to elicit more profound effects than they would on their own. It may also be beneficial to supplement with a **standard multivitamin** for additional support.

Beginner IV - More Questions,"1) Lets say I missed a shot in my arm what would happen to my arm? How would my arm look and how long will it take for my arm to look normal again?

2) I never understood how people miss their shots. Like when you press down the plunger wouldn’t it sting or hurt causing you to stop since that is a sign you missed? Or is there times where you don’t feel anything at all but end up finding out you missed later on? Any additional info welcome.

3) My elbow crook is very meaty and fatty causing issues with feeling the vein and knowing where the vein is going etc. How can I be able to palpate and feel the vein when there is firm meat and fat over it?

2-map harm reduction questions while on suboxone?,"So this stuff is crystalline, some broken powder, burns like crazy and am just taking talking small taste of it… I took low dose of subox and decided to try smoking a little because I couldn’t stand the burn from it… anyways the feeling of doing about.01g was somewhat decent, but I got a slight headache and didn’t want to go any deeper having a busy day tomorrow. Are there any tips to make this stuff enjoyable,(other than obviously letting the subs wear off), I’d like to get a good shot of it but the amount of water needed would fit it normally 10cc sharp.
  For context of my tolerance, I’m 34 and was prescribed fentanyl patches starting age 19-24then 80mg methadone plus kpins. —I quit all them a few years back and am on 16mg bupe/naloxone.
   So what could I do to make this stuff able to shoot,(just one time I’m saving my veins seriously), and then for smoking it should I be getting these slight headaches? Does this stuff have any recreational use? Maybe add vit c to it or something? I expected more… almost feels like I need to dissolve in water and let it dry into a crystal form again? Or filter it some way. 
  If anyone can help I’m gonna try this out so might as well do the least amount of damage.

Having trouble with arm veins. New to IV and don’t know what I am doing wrong?,"1) I have to avoid my middle vein of my arm crook since I have yellow bruising. So I’m trying to feel for the veins towards the elbow. But this area feels very firm since I have fatty muscle. I can see the vein but when I try feel for it it’s very hard to feel and know which direction it is going etc. I have tried a tourniquet but they don’t work for me. How can I be sure which direction the vein is going and how can I feel the vein under the this firm muscle area?

2) People say to aspirate to get a air bubble vacuum when you stick the needle in. But how come when I pull the plunger back there is resistance and cannot be pulled back? I have never got a plume of blood before. Only once I had this very thin line of blood which was barely able to be seen. But I have never been able to create the air bubble vacuum people talks about.

3) When trying to puncture the skin with needle is it best to have the needle tip right on the skin you before you are going to puncture or should you have it a few cm away? Sometimes I find the needle doesn’t puncture as easily and I don’t know why.

4) When taking the needle out of the skin it always nicks on the way out causing a bigger hole. How should I be taking the needle out without nicking?

I don't know if anyone else has used this tool, but I've found it quite useful in checking my own medications I get from my doctor (pharmacists can make mistakes so it's always good to double check), and pills I got back in my heavy drug use days. All you need to do is go to this website, enter the information from the pill, and hit search. It will bring up medications that fit the information, usually with pictures.

This is the level of harm reduction I teach.,"The 10 Commandments of Safer Drug Use

1. Research, research, and research your drug of choice. Know all relevant information, including onset time, duration, likely effects, combination data and possible contra-indications.
2. Source carefully. How confident are you that the substance is exactly what you expect it to be and is not contaminated?
3. Test it: it's easier than you may think. Or have it tested by a trusted third party. If you are less than 100% certain about its content or purity dump it.
4. Properly and rationally consider the dose. Always remember that you can take more if you need to, but you cannot un-take it. Take your time and don't make hasty decisions or be unduly influenced by others.
5. Weigh your dose carefully, and never eyeball it. Invest in and use some reliable milligram scales. Use volumetric weighing where appropriate.
6. Perform simple allergy tests; for instance by placing of the tiniest fragment under or on to your tongue and monitoring for a reaction.
7. Ask yourself if you are feeling okay. If you are unwell, sick, or in poor health, or in any doubt about this, don’t proceed. This also applies to your mental health.
8. Plan the experience, and its parameters, so that you don’t take rash decisions under the influence. This may include: setting a redosing limit by restricting access to more; ensuring a safe and suitable set and setting; having water, food and entertainment available, etcetera.
9. Have the contact details of help services to hand in case of urgent need. Write down what you are dosing and place the note in a prominent place on your person. If you are undertaking the experience with a group, seek to nominate an individual to abstain, in case help and objective rationality is needed.
10. Give your body plenty of time to recover and your mind due time to assimilate the experience. In other words, if you are a regular drug user, take a break between psychoactive sessions, and a long break between sessions using substances from the same class.

Questions about safer drug usage of MDMA and others,"I want to try out MDMA and maybe other drugs in the future. I informed myself quite well about drugs in general and their effects. I still got some questions I hope you can answer.

So I heard that when you take MDMA your stomach hurts, you have a feeling of fullness etc. Is there anything I can do or take to prevent / get rid of this? E.g. take Bicarbonate of Soda to relax the stomach. Does this help? Is it free of risk to take it and can I take it meanwhile I am on MDMA? What else can I take during the trip and before or after it?

I read about dehydration but also the opposite. Are there any drinks you recommend that can be taken that help to deal with it?

Are there minerals / vitamines that I should take (Calcium, Magnesium etc.)?

Can the serotonin production be supported by supplements to reduce the side effects?

Participated in my first Kensington outreach w local organization,"Hi everyone!! I’m a nurse from northeastern PA and yesterday I went to do wound care with a local (non religious, non 12 step affiliated just plain ol harm reduction) organization. I traveled from two hours north east and took the train/el into Allegheny station. It felt like I was in another world, there was so much suffering all around me. It was absolute insanity and my heart is broken for the PWUD/PWID especially with philly being in a code blue this weekend due to the freezing temperatures. I was able to successfully provide wound care to about four people who were so kind. The organization also gave out hygiene kits, narcan, clean syringes, cookers, etc. I’m so grateful to have been able to have come down and help and am definitely going to come again but I do have some questions if anyone could help. 
1. I felt like we met some resistance to doing wound care, I spoke to at least two different people who looked like they had really BAD tranq dope wounds who just would not let us do wound care. Is there anyway to approach someone who is resistant to allow us to help them or any better way? I just don’t want to see anyone end up with a worse infection.
2. What are the key things we should be bringing with us right now? The organization we go out with has clothing donations/coats/hygiene kits/works etc but I was wondering if there’s anything else me and my friend could bring to pass out that would make a difference for someone? 
3. I guess in general tips to approach people so they trust us and are willing to get supplies from us??

Why censorship kills harm reduction,"Ive seen many posts (in other subs) the last week about keeping folks from talking about illicit drug use so that the gov doesnt use the info to ban substances or make obtaining harder.

But if doing so means that we have to hush about why we are using and not ask questions then all is lost. Harm Reduction depends on knowledge and until now its been very difficult for people to gain knowledge on things that werent published. How will the ketamine snorter know that spitting could save his bladder if theres no one talking about snorting, or boofing, etc...

Perfect example: I spent a good year trying to educate in the kratom ""community"" and its dangerous how they treat HR. Those folks are so scared the FDA will ban their plant that they are sweeping reality under the rug. Denying facts and lying. SO folks new to kratom think it's harmless ""just like coffee"" and pregnant women are using it under the pretense that it is not an opioid. Guy is Georgia just died from mixing kratom extracts (which the community deems as safe as food) with hydroxizine. Maybe if the dude had a factual forum to go to and get the information that antihistamines and kratom interact, it could have been avoided? Maybe not but I can assure you that due to censorship by kratom users, this info was unavailable. Making harm reduction impossible.

This is the conundrum that is harm reduction and many folks could argue all day on it. In the end, censoring info does more harm than good in my opinion, and Elon Musk's ;)",14,5,2022-11-18 12:51:03,censorship kills harm reduction ive seen many posts subs last week keeping folks talking illicit drug use gov doesnt use info ban substances make obtaining harder means hush using ask questions lost harm reduction depends knowledge difficult people gain knowledge things werent published ketamine snorter know spitting could save bladder theres one talking snorting boofing etc ... perfect example spent good year trying educate kratom `` community '' dangerous treat hr folks scared fda ban plant sweeping reality rug denying facts lying folks new kratom think 's harmless `` like coffee '' pregnant women using pretense opioid guy georgia died mixing kratom extracts community deems safe food hydroxizine maybe dude factual forum go get information antihistamines kratom interact could avoided maybe assure due censorship kratom users info unavailable making harm reduction impossible conundrum harm reduction many folks could argue day end censoring info harm good opinion elon musk 's

Does cycling intoxicant types decrease the risk of addiction?,"I have an incurable cancer and have not recovered from a recent horrible breakup. I reached out to a therapist ages ago, and have my first proper session within a few days.

Currently, my mental health is awful. I cope short-term by following a cycle: benzos on one day, weed the next day, then opioids, then alcohol, then a day of sobriety. All intoxicants are fairly safely obtained, whether purchased by me from a licensed vendor or retrieved from prescriptions related to my cancer diagnosis.

Am I at any significant risk of addiction if I continue a cycle like this? Any tips on how to keep myself in check?

I'm developing some new resources for the Drug Checking(pill testing) organisation I work with and I'm hoping y'all can help me find a graphic to communicate a point about why drug checking exists.  
Looking for an image that visualised the proliferation of novel psychoactive substances (NPS). In my head this could be like a family tree of drugs. Some of the basic or prototypical drug structures (Phenethylamine, Tryptamine, Benzodiazapine, Morphine, etc....) could have their own 'trunks' on this tree, then the various derivatives and analogues form branches and stems from there.

The best I've found in my own searching are below.

Mushrooms advice,"Hi there. I'm a Harm Reduction worker myself so this seems a little silly considering what we're facing. However..I have a work retreat for 3 days. I'm a recovering alcoholic (abstained fully 11 ""California sober"" lol sorry. The last 3)  everyone will be drunk. I'm cool with it normally but normally I can go home.  I don't really get ""high"" when I smoke. It's daily. But it's been a loooong time since ive had anything stronger than pot.  (I may have also had a tiny crack addiction with the booze) Anyway I was considering microdosing mushrooms or maybe make a tea for something a little stronger. I'm looking for a little,mellow giggle and really the desire to sit around a campfire with a bunch of drunk people. Which leads me to 2 questions 
1. Bad idea? I know we can't answer for anyone but lived experience? I dont want it to become a ""thing"" or trigger anything pot is cool if this is that fucker back.  and I already have anxiety shit going on. I don't remember shroom highs. I was a teenager last time. is it even mellow giggley lol. I'm old now.

I'm burning out,"I've only been working as a harm reduction worker since the start of the year and I already feel like I'm burning out. The last couple of months have been awful, and now everyone is terrified of spending a winter sleeping outside in -30 C weather and their baseline level of stress is so high that people have been going off on us lately about things that wouldn't have bothered them a few weeks ago. 

That is on top of having had four clients (that we are aware of) die of overdose in a 4 or 5 week period, and constant pushback by some community members in local media and on social media. Our town also just announced that we will not be getting an overdose prevention site, because there is no funding for it. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I've started dreaming about people dying.

It feels like I'm living through a war, but that everyone else in my life outside of my work is just going on with their day. I don't know how to function as if there is an emergency all day at work, and then somehow turn that off in the evenings and on the weekends. Every day I see clients walk out the door and I wonder if they'll be next. We give them clean supplies and as much naloxone as they can carry, and we try to get them into stable housing, but there just isn't capacity to help everyone and it gets more and more soul-crushing every time I have to say ""I'm sorry, there isn't really anything more I can do for you right now.""

I don't really know what the point of this post is, other than to share with people who might understand.",36,21,2022-10-08 11:54:31,'m burning 've working harm reduction worker since start year already feel like 'm burning last couple months awful everyone terrified spending winter sleeping outside -30 c weather baseline level stress high people going us lately things would n't bothered weeks ago top four clients aware die overdose 4 5 week period constant pushback community members local media social media town also announced getting overdose prevention site funding n't know anymore 've started dreaming people dying feels like 'm living war everyone else life outside work going day n't know function emergency day work somehow turn evenings weekends every day see clients walk door wonder 'll next give clean supplies much naloxone carry try get stable housing n't capacity help everyone gets soul-crushing every time say `` 'm sorry n't really anything right '' n't really know point post share people might understand

The Drug Users Bible: The End Of The Journey,"The complete version of *The Drug Users Bible* has now been published: and this definitely is the final cut. I’m getting too old for the constant drug touring, and the ride cannot go on for ever.

For this edition I added an extra 25 psychoactives, bringing the total to 182. These were:

* 3-MMC
* a-PHP
* Carisoprodol
* Zopiclone
* Sentia
* 3-HO-PCP
* Snus
* 5-MeO-DMT
* Modafinil
* Sananga
* Ginseng
* Green Tea
* Horny Goat Weed
* Yerba Mate
* Cacao
* DOM
* Chamomile
* TMA
* Hops
* Mullein
* Saffron
* 5-HTP
* Mad Honey
* Essential Oils
* 1cP-LSD

Some of these were definitely scraping the bottom of the barrel but I had to cover them for some sort of completeness (at least in terms of common perception).

Various sections were also substantially expanded, some new segments were added, and a significant number of previous reports were extended/improved or added to. The new page count is 636, making it literally a weighty tome.

More information is available on the book’s website or on Amazon.

Finally, my 12 year journey has ended, but it isn’t the end of the road. I will continue to ‘research’, to post on parts of social media, and attempt to disseminate harm reduction information wherever and whenever I can.  You haven’t heard the last of me.

Regarding the book, I hope it continues to be a useful resource in preventing tragedy, both now and long after I have shuffled off this mortal coil.

Finally, please don’t hesitate to ask any questions or post comments, or most of all, if you ever need help and you think I can assist, drop me a private message. Stay safe.

Anyone else going to the National Harm Reduction conference next month?,"There’s supposed to be an official announcement on Monday about whether or not it’s cancelled. For those unaware, the location is Puerto Rico. 

Some people have already pulled out. I already sunk at least a grand into airfare and registration, not to mention the work I’ve done for my presentation, so I selfishly want to go anyway. Yet, I don’t want to take up precious resources from the residents of PR like a privileged tourist. Maybe all the money I’ll spend at the hotel bar is an investment in the local economy. 

Choosing PR as the location during hurricane season was just a bad idea on NHRC’s part…. not to mention that the travel cost is expensive for everyone. It’s not low-barrier and it’s not harm reduction. It’s exclusivity. 

Thanks for letting me rant.

I didn't pass out, didn't gasp for air, no shortness of breath. Did feel mild anxiety/palpitations but no chest pain or shortness of breath. I had two beers later that evening which was a PBR can beer and a Stella Artois. Nothing happened really as far I remember, maybe a little tipsy but I didn't pass out at the  bar, didn't throw up at the bar.  I did hydrate a bit with water at the bar.

Mixing supplements? Help please?,"[The supplements](https://imgur.com/a/mVvPWLB)


Coming off of a short binge. Still currently taking benzos everyday (as needed). They’re pressed. I’m 90% sure theyre flualp. Not quite ready to start fully tapering yet. Only been at it for a month. And this is actually a lot more responsible/honest than I’ve ever been before.  But I know it won’t last forever.

So I bought a bunch of supplements. I plan on tapering off soon. I have plenty. But I wanted to make things as safe/easy as possible. I went cold turkey last year and had a seizure. Lesson learned lol.

So I’m very curious about any information anecdotal experiences. I would really appreciate the help. 

L-Theanine: When would you take it? And how often? Dosage, etc

Magnesium Oxide: Anything noticeable? Any routine with it?

Ashwagandha: Same basic questions. Dosage, effects, timing, etc?

GABA: Was surprised to find this just straight up. 750mg capsule. Figured I would grab one just in case it’s any use. Any advice?

Niacin: I remember using this back in 2008 to try to pass a drug test. Was super uncomfortable. Any other experiences? I also heard to take it with Vitamin c

Vitamin C: I assume this just feels like taking vitamin C lol

Magnesium chelated supplement: Any experience with different forms of Magnesium?

I found one Magnesium+Ashwagandha combo with Magnesium Glycinate which I’ve heard can be good

And lastly, a combo of L-Theanine and Gaba. Figured it might have potential?

I’m really curious about dosages and timing. I’m coming off a short binge. I wanna give myself enough to bounce back. Hoping some supplements will help me ease back into things. And then time to take a break.

But in the meantime, any advice or experience would be really appreciated. Really hoping to feel decent by the end of the weekend :/

is this safe?,"TL;DR would 180mg of pregabalin be safe to take during the crash after a 48 hour binge of small doses of adderall and xanax analogues?


I pulled an all nighter. The past 36 hours, I’ve been mixing small doses adderall and xanax to keep myself up. 

Both the adderall and xanax are pressed. I know they’re fake, but they’re just analogues. Didn’t test positive for anything crazy like fentanyl.

I take these things pretty often. They’re pretty light doses. I space em out and I’m pretty decent at balancing my hydration and vitamins and stuff. Harm reduction, etc. I worry about my GABA receptors though.

ANYWAY. My question is. I can feel a crash coming. And I might have pushed into the territory of potential withdrawal.

What about 180mg of pregabalin?

I’ve never done it before.

But these all nighters are becoming a little more frequent. And I can tell I’m starting to feel a slight dependency with the adderall and xanax (or whatever analogues)

So as someone who’s been taking those 2 pills pretty regularly, but also somewhat responsibly:

would 180mg of pregabalin be safe to take during the crash after a 48 hour binge of small doses?

The reason i’m worried is just because some of the drugs will definitely still be in my system and mix with the pregabalin. Also, a couple years ago i had a seizure from some pretty serious benzo withdrawal. 

Idk if my GABA receptors are fucked up or not but they’re bound to be at least a little bit fried lol.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

What's in your drugs? Does your part of the world still have heroin (diacetylmorphine)?,"I live in Canada, was born and raised in Texas. I started using heroin in 2006, where at least in my region, fentanyl was mostly only in pharmaceutical patches, very rarely used to lace heroin. I remember the feeling of the drugs changing dramatically as fent tore through the scene leaving a trail of bodies. Before long, you were just buying opioid powder of inconsistent value and it rarely gave all the desired effects of a heroin user. In affect, heroin was a thing of the past for me.  After moving to Canada, I was somewhat refreshed to see that it wasn't being sold as heroin, but rather was called 'down' and it's bright and colorful, at least we know what we're buying? Nope. Can't even trust what look like pharma drugs. I'm posting a link to a study done in Toronto at the end of 2020 showing that 77% of what was being sold as fentanyl contained benzodiazepines, none of the 'heroin' samples contained heroin,  and only 5% of the 'fent' tested contained only fentanyl.  A lot of what's being sold as fentanyl here in Moncton doesn't even test positive for fentanyl or the other usual suspects (eg: isotonitazene), so we can't even venture a guess with the available equipment. I know from personal experience that these issues have undoubtedly become worse since this study was done.  The overdoses as well as substance use and homelessness have exponentially grown in the past 2 years here.  Do you use or and/or work with the drug using community? I'd like to know what the climate is like in other parts of the world. Heroin is (or was) a massive international export/important used to fund wars and it's hard to imagine how it seems to have gone away.

Drug anxiety,This only used to happen to me when smoking weed and where I would get really anxious before smoking. It went away and as I have tried other drugs the anxiety went. Now whenever I’m going to do a substance I feel rly anxious and it’s almost like my brain only remembers the bad times on drugs. Is this normal because it’s annoying and ruins my drug experiences.

Are Test Kits Good Enough??,"I know this question is slightly vague so let me go a little more depth. More specifically are reagent kits and fentanyl strips accurate enough? I understand that they can help to narrow down to a specific substance, but my problem is how accurate it is? I am very thankful for test kits, but I have a few concerns. My concerns involve how the hues on the color chart are so close together, and sometimes it can be hard to decipher. How can you pinpoint a certain substance if there are multiple other substances in it? How do cutting agents affect the results? One of my biggest concerns involving fentanyl test strips- If a person does not follow the directions to a T they could end up with a false positive or vice versa. I made this post just to hear other peoples thoughts on these kits.

Can I take a piece of Xanax with this 100mg Tramadol?,"I ask because I’ve read about the risk of seizure.      

    I once abused benzos for a few months and then quit cold turkey and had a seizure. That was a couple years ago though. I cleaned up my act and stopped being so irresponsible.      


      Anyway, I got my hands on two Pharmacy Legit 100mg Tramadol capsules. I have two different types of benzos i’m using on/off right now. One is pharmacy Alprazolam, the other is a pressed pill with Flualoprazolam and Etizolam. Similar but not quite the same.     


     I’ve heard some people say to ALWAYS take benzos when you take tramadol to prevent seizures. I’ve heard other people say combining it with benzos can INCREASE the chances of a seizure.    


      I’m a very experienced drug user across pretty much everything. Tramadol is just one where the anecdotal reports are so inconsistent.    

      I should also mention that I take Adderall most days. But don’t have to. Especially not the same day I would be taking the Tramadol. I read about that “Serotonin Syndrome” thing or whatever and that sounds scary lol    


    Anyway. I have no idea what to think. Because I know it’s chemically the right kinda opiate for me with how my body processes O-DSMT I would love to be able to take it.

Opening mobile HR site,"Howdy! The past few years my partner and I (both in long term recovery from IV opiod/meth use) have been doing on the ground distribution of sterile using supplies and narcan/naloxone and testing strips. We were working separately and came together and the past year have been working together to train staff at bars and venues, making overdose  kits and doing trainings at events, and person to person pick ups and drop offs. Anyway with the traction that we’ve gained and with the help of our mutual ally in our cities HR alliance we have embarked on a mission to open a mobile site for a needle exchange and naloxone distrobution and training via a decommissioned ice cream truck. At first our purchase and registration of the vehicle was okayed by the HR council and now they’re having cold feet about writing it into the budget (most of their funding is going to a program that writes a one time 2 week script for suboxone for established maintenance patients). We’re off to a good start with the crowd funding , but I’m wondering if there are any grants we could apply for or any organizations we could talk to on a national level?  We live in one of the largest cities in the country, and there is not a solid exchange program here which is crazy to me. Also the means to have an abundant and consistent supply of naloxone has been hard to come by and for people the people active addiction who really need it do not have the consistent place to obtain these supplies . People are more or less getting supplies sporadically from individuals like us and the ocasional underfunded recovery center. 

Anyway a shot in the dark here but I’m wondering if anybody has any advice or can point us in the right direction? 

Am also willing to elaborate further thanks y’all 🙏",14,6,2022-08-14 04:19:59,opening mobile hr site howdy past years partner long term recovery iv opiod/meth use ground distribution sterile using supplies narcan/naloxone testing strips working separately came together past year working together train staff bars venues making overdose kits trainings events person person pick ups drop offs anyway traction ’ gained help mutual ally cities hr alliance embarked mission open mobile site needle exchange naloxone distrobution training via decommissioned ice cream truck first purchase registration vehicle okayed hr council ’ cold feet writing budget funding going program writes one time 2 week script suboxone established maintenance patients ’ good start crowd funding ’ wondering grants could apply organizations could talk national level live one largest cities country solid exchange program crazy also means abundant consistent supply naloxone hard come people people active addiction really need consistent place obtain supplies people less getting supplies sporadically individuals like us ocasional underfunded recovery center anyway shot dark ’ wondering anybody advice point us right direction also willing elaborate thanks ’ 🙏
"First time taking MDMA at a festival, some harm-reduction questions"," 

Hi everybody,

Im going to a festivel and for the first day we plan to drink, smoke some weed and to ""party"" in general.  
The second day we plan to drink a bit in the morning then smoke some weed and around 6pm we plan to do MDMA (for the 1st time).

Things I have concerns are:

* **1.** Is it a good idea to have a **first time** MDMA **experience** at a **festival**?
* **2.** How **much mg** should I take ? (80-90kg male)
* **3.** Is it a good idea to take **MDMA without** a **good** night **rest** before ? - I mean we won´t be getting  
really good sleep because we are goona sleep in a tent - are there going to be **any adverse side-effects - bad experience**?
* **4.** How much **can I drink alcohol** // how long should I not be drinking before dropping? Or should I avoid drinking that day at all?
* **5**. If a friend is **stressed/anxious** about upcoming examination in 12 days, is it better for him not to take MDMA - is here a **high possibility** for **bad trip** / **panic attack**?
* **6.** Is the body load and anxiety something too much that I should prepare for?

P.S. I was thinking abou 100mg, I bought gatorade, magnesium, vit. C, chewing gums and ginger-shot (idk if it helps)

Sorry for so many questions but I really want to get this done right.

Meth harm reduction personal opinion after losing my mind for a whole year,"System failed after showing up pictures of poly drug heavy users as a meth antipropaganda instead educating people on real facts about how meth works and how psychosis is provoked.

Meth psychosis is not a direct consequence from using, it’s a consequence from the side effects from the drug. Information that FDA knows perfectly since they aproved the substance decades ago. Psychosis it’s triggered by sleep deprivation, not drinking water and not eating. 

It’s well knowing truckers use the drug wordwide to keep awake at night, truckers drink, eat and sleep and bananas from Chile gets into any Costco without a problem.

I bring my self back from madness, others keep on its darkness and misery.

Just BC a system failure, a system that didn’t want to let people know if they sleep, drink water and eat properly while using, it  will be so rare  reaching psych unit because horrid and weird delusions. 

I was 34, but there’s kids about 14 o 13 getting delusions that leads into suicidal ideations because sleep deprivation, mal nourished and dehydration, after suicidal ideation there is only misery and madness.

Being hooked by this substance it’s just a living hell. 
 
Federation failures points on drugadicts and relegated un to the bottom from the bottom of the useless and nasty, while they aproved that shit and washed their hands when everything goes wrong.

Harm reduction should be re-educate those motherfuckers into not approving shit, but they keep doing it as they approved the oxys because the money, it’s all about the money.

How many kids you know. OD and died from the oxys?

Cocaine addiction recovery,"Long post, sorry. I’ve been working really hard to stay sober. It’s been really hard and i’m scared of slipping.

Harm Reduction Anonymous,"I was curious if anyone was interested this?

Hello there! ♥

Thank you for joining Harm Reduction Anonymous.

The primary purpose of Harm Reduction Anonymous is to celebrate wins of all kinds. These wins must be recognized.

Throughout my time in the rooms, I found the all or nothing mentality leading me back to hard drugs time and time again.

I want to let you know that even if you smoke weed, or drink occasionally, the purpose of this group is to focus on the positives and trying to be better just 1 percent every day!

Did you used to shoot heroin everyday and it destroyed your life...? But now you smoke it once a day? That's a huge accomplishment!

This isn't to say that abstinence isn't possible..! but we want to meet people where they are! Stepping stones! 

A dead addict is one that can't recover. Even though the rooms ""welcome"" those currently under the influence, you still feel ""out of place""

I want you to know that if it's a choice between smoking marijuana or fentanyl, I would much rather you not roll the dice...

Any action we make is either conducive or destructive to our future.. The minute that we feel as if all the work we put in was for nothing is the minute I get loaded...

If marijuana saves you from meth or heroin or fentanyl, you are WELCOME HERE.

At the end of the day it's all about behaviors. You can be on suboxone rebuilding your life or destroying it. I want to guide everyone to see that any accomplishment on a daily basis is progress that wasn't made a week before!

YOU ARE a beautiful soul worthy of happiness, no matter the depths you've been down, you don't have to feel alone anymore ♥.",20,4,2022-07-26 20:39:07,harm reduction anonymous curious anyone interested hello ♥ thank joining harm reduction anonymous primary purpose harm reduction anonymous celebrate wins kinds wins must recognized throughout time rooms found nothing mentality leading back hard drugs time time want let know even smoke weed drink occasionally purpose group focus positives trying better 1 percent every day used shoot heroin everyday destroyed life ... smoke day 's huge accomplishment n't say abstinence n't possible .. want meet people stepping stones dead addict one ca n't recover even though rooms `` welcome '' currently influence still feel `` place '' want know 's choice smoking marijuana fentanyl would much rather roll dice ... action make either conducive destructive future .. minute feel work put nothing minute get loaded ... marijuana saves meth heroin fentanyl welcome end day 's behaviors suboxone rebuilding life destroying want guide everyone see accomplishment daily basis progress n't made week beautiful soul worthy happiness matter depths 've n't feel alone anymore ♥

Wilful Ignorance – A Dead-End Conversation With an Anti-Drug Moralist,"I wanted to share a bit of a mindboggling exchange I had with a family member who, though I've been well aware of her fervently anti-drug attitude for years, almost to my disbelief finally laid out her incredibly simplistic views on harm reduction and discussion around the topic of drugs of any kind.

My apologies in advance if this doesn't fit the usual format for this subreddit, but I thought it the perfect place to air out some of the dumbfounding perspectives that I know many people hold through some good ol' storytelling. Hopefully I've done an OK job. Please be sure to let me know and share your own thoughts/experiences!

–––

After reading a short article on Sky News about a study on the correlation between even low-frequency consumption of alcohol and the development of health conditions, I tried to speak to my mother about the outcome of the research. I explained that although the findings recommend an average daily maximum of 38ml of beer for people under 40, the study was observational and likely did not account for socioeconomic factors, and certainly not for the direction of causation to consequence.

It is a possibility, I conceded, that the prevalence of health burdens such as cardiovascular disease or cancer in moderate users could, in fact, be due to other circumstances which led them to consuming alcohol even at lower rates. She was confused at this caveat, as she immediately assumed from the conclusion of the study that the scientists were directly monitoring the immediate impact of alcohol consumption, before I tried to clarify that the study was purely an analysis of discrete data.

I likened the situation to the crack epidemic among black communities in the United States. It wasn't that being black *in itself*, I told her, was what caused those people to become addicted users of crack, but the racial discrimination, financial insecurity, and the destructive strategies targeted at people of colour by the government that in turn caused this rise in drug use. That if researchers, and subsequently the general public, believed that addiction to crack was a characteristic inherent to black communities, they would be ignoring all of the poverty and systemic racism that ruined what would otherwise have been normal neighbourhoods. Funnily enough, this is exactly what happened for many decades.

What astonished me was her first reaction to the sombre example I drew upon. It wasn't sympathy for those communities, or a curiosity about why they were afflicted with this drug epidemic in the first place. She simply asserted, ""But cocaine is expensive. Those black people couldn't afford cocaine."" Even after I told her, ""Yes, it was crack that was systematically injected into those communities,"" her stubbornness only continued as she declared that ""Crack is not cocaine.""

Surprised at her uncompassionate response, I said ""You really don't know much about drugs, do you?"" Her attitude immediately became aggressive. ""There are things in this world that are not worth knowing,"" she said, as if her wilful ignorance was a point of pride. I thought it rather uncaring of her to admit something like that, when so many of her friends from her teenage years suffered from drug addictions. She didn't even want to know why they fell into those traps, or what could have been done to help them. Every time I pressed her to recount the stories, the conversation always became a stale, reductionist repetition of ""They started with weed, then they wanted more and more, and then they ruined their lives and died."" No motives, no assessment of exactly *what* they had become addicted to. It was a completely black and white thing, a perspective long outdated in the scientific community yet immovably ingrained in her disdain for what she considers immoral.

When I tried to relate the topic back to alcohol, wanting to return to the good reasons for knowing what a drug can do to you even in small doses, and through exactly what mechanisms this occurs, she remained fixed in this nonchalant, ""not my problem"" sort of attitude. It didn't matter whether or not one bottle of beer every weekend is actually bad for you (or more importantly, for *her*). She snapped at me as if I was calling her an alcoholic. ""Are you saying I drink?"" I told her, ""you literally drank a bottle of beer yesterday. I'm saying that one day, you might find that even that amount is enough to cause you problems.""

""But it won't be, because I won't drink again for a few days and my body will have flushed it out. So there's no problem,"" she responded. And that's how I knew she hadn't listened to a word I said.

So I gave up, got up, and said good night.",17,1,2022-07-17 22:17:25,wilful ignorance – dead-end conversation anti-drug moralist wanted share bit mindboggling exchange family member though 've well aware fervently anti-drug attitude years almost disbelief finally laid incredibly simplistic views harm reduction discussion around topic drugs kind apologies advance n't fit usual format subreddit thought perfect place air dumbfounding perspectives know many people hold good ol storytelling hopefully 've done ok job please sure let know share thoughts/experiences ––– reading short article sky news study correlation even low-frequency consumption alcohol development health conditions tried speak mother outcome research explained although findings recommend average daily maximum 38ml beer people 40 study observational likely account socioeconomic factors certainly direction causation consequence possibility conceded prevalence health burdens cardiovascular disease cancer moderate users could fact due circumstances led consuming alcohol even lower rates confused caveat immediately assumed conclusion study scientists directly monitoring immediate impact alcohol consumption tried clarify study purely analysis discrete data likened situation crack epidemic among black communities united states n't black told caused people become addicted users crack racial discrimination financial insecurity destructive strategies targeted people colour government turn caused rise drug use researchers subsequently general public believed addiction crack characteristic inherent black communities would ignoring poverty systemic racism ruined would otherwise normal neighbourhoods funnily enough exactly happened many decades astonished first reaction sombre example drew upon n't sympathy communities curiosity afflicted drug epidemic first place simply asserted `` cocaine expensive black people could n't afford cocaine '' even told `` yes crack systematically injected communities '' stubbornness continued declared `` crack cocaine '' surprised uncompassionate response said `` really n't know much drugs '' attitude immediately became aggressive `` things world worth knowing '' said wilful ignorance point pride thought rather uncaring admit something like many friends teenage years suffered drug addictions n't even want know fell traps could done help every time pressed recount stories conversation always became stale reductionist repetition `` started weed wanted ruined lives died '' motives assessment exactly become addicted completely black white thing perspective long outdated scientific community yet immovably ingrained disdain considers immoral tried relate topic back alcohol wanting return good reasons knowing drug even small doses exactly mechanisms occurs remained fixed nonchalant `` problem '' sort attitude n't matter whether one bottle beer every weekend actually bad importantly snapped calling alcoholic `` saying drink '' told `` literally drank bottle beer yesterday 'm saying one day might find even amount enough cause problems '' `` wo n't wo n't drink days body flushed 's problem '' responded 's knew n't listened word said gave got said good night

I went today to exchange my expired kit to a new one and asked the pharmacists if they had Narcan, the spray, available. They didn’t but the pharmacist looked it up in her computer and to both of our surprise Narcan would have cost me $155.00.  I’m so confused as to why the injectable is free and the Narcan isn’t?

How do i become sober & forgive myself?,"I’m in a bit of mental fog, feels like i was possessed by my demons for a few hours

I endured through irresistible sexual cravings and searched desperately for the stimulation to quell my innermost addiction ….. an addiction i wish to leave behind & try to forget  …. only to find myself afterwards feeling a feverish hell of guilt, shame, sickness, and pain

I just didn’t have the strength, i wasn’t strong enough to make it through the sickness that followed  … and i rolled a joint. 

The high revealed me to myself, it was kind of frightening, but meaningless at the same time. it’s still THC

Is this because i took 1.7g of mushrooms yesterday? Is this because i smoke weed on a regular?

I’m thinking about whether or not i should stay up all night, clear away this sickness/withdrawal with punishment? i’ve already over-indulged in food

I just don’t have the right words. 

I need sobreity.

How do you acheive sobriety? how do you think i should go about doing the same thing?

How do i find genuine happiness and interest in life like i used to?

I spend a lot of time on tik tok and see “cali sober people” who are happy enjoying life and smoking weed. Many of these people are ex 12 steppers. To get to the point I want to smoke weed.. but if I do my gf who’s also in “recovery” will probably leave me I’ll lose my apartment and my job through a local recovery center. I’m fine with losing these things my relationships on the fritz anyways and I hate my job. Has anyone been through this..

Can anyone verify this?,"When produced from phenyl-2-propanone, a 50:50 mixture of both isomers is formed. This is called a “racemic” mixture, written as “dl”-meth. dl-meth (“biker meth”, “crank”) is roughly half as potent as d-meth and forms a powder on its own rather than large crystals. This is sometimes cooked up for more bag appeal, as it will form crystals when melted with MSM/other cuts.

My question is this: Todays mass produced methamphetamine is racemic, but it also comes often in very large crystals which one wouldn’t expect to see if the above paragraph is true, and by accounts the old school biker meth was as made with P2P as it’s precurser and came as a powder.

Fentanyl bioavailability question,"We hear a lot in media and from Public Health agencies about how individual fentanyl pills (“blues”) often contain lethal doses. In harm reduction work, we encourage smoking with a bubble over other forms of ingesting, and my understanding it’s not just because of wanting to reduce disease transmission from shared sharps + wound infections, but also reducing bio-availability. Many people I’ve worked with report smoking as many as 10-30 blues a day. Would those likely be lethal orally? I’m struggling to find any scientific documentation of that - what percent of an opiate is bioavailable when smoked vs orally ingested vs injected? It seems like common sense for me, from how cannabis is, that smoking is an inefficient but fast acting method. If that’s true, it’d make sense how a teenager might overdose thinking they swallowed an actual Oxy for recreational use, while someone who uses drugs and knows it’s fentanyl would smoke it and be alright. 

In the last couple years most illicit opioid use has transitioned from injection to smoking. Has this been a survival tactic with the contents of the supply getting so much more random?

We hear how the Colorado law making 1g of fentanyl possession a felony would mean as little as 10 blues, yet other reports saying 1g is thousands of times a lethal dose.

Any guidance on this subject would be helpful!
