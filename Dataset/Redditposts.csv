UCPD Case # 17-01468
 
On Monday, June 5, 2017 at approximately 3:31 p.m. an attempted homicide occurred in People’s Park.  The female suspect approached a 2-year old male who was at the park’s play structure with his nanny.  The suspect walked up to the 2-year old and placed something in his mouth.  She immediately checked the boy's mouth and found nothing in it.  The nanny called UCPD to report the incident.  Officers and paramedics responded and the suspect was taken into custody for a psychiatric evaluation.  While in route to the holding facility the suspect told the paramedics that she had given the child methamphetamines.  The toddler was taken to a local hospital where it was determined that the suspect had given the child methamphetamine.  The child is recovering in a local hospital.  The suspect has been arrested for attempted homicide.
 
The suspect is described as: 
 
THOMAS, Sayyadina, a Black female, 36 years of age, 5’5” in height, 215 lbs., with black hair and brown eyes.

My mum just allows the mental, verbal and sometimes physical abuse to happen.
I have tried to explain to them that for me to get clean and make it through the hell that is opiate withdrawal it takes alot of mental strength and support from loved ones to make it through and just now I again reminded them of that fact only for my dad to shout at me that I'm a waste of space and they aren't doing anything to stop my detox plans...
How can I go through withdrawals while not being allowed to rest in peace or receive 0 help and support whatsoever in such a toxic environment? Last time I tried I attempted suicide by hanging February 10th last year and you'd think that would give them some idea how dire my mental state is yet here we are almost a year to the date and I am once again extremely suicidal...
I wish i was well enough mentally and physically to get a decent paying job to get the hell away from these monsters.
Also I'd like to add I've never lied, cheated, stolen or allowed my addiction to impact their lives in any way but I am their personal daily dog walker, sitter and house sitter when they go on holiday and despite paying them rent every month I'm not even allowed to use the electricity yet everytime my dad gets a high energy bill he balmes it on me. My brother is not only older than me, rich enough to move out, drives an Audi, has his own espresso machine, mini fridge, two tvs, 2 computers in his room and a vile personality to boot he somehow gets 0 pressure to move out or abuse from my parents and has been the favourite my whole life.
At 13 I was sexually abused by my parents friends son in his bedroom where they would leave me with to go get drunk downstairs with the dad every weekend, I've been in 2 major car accidents neither of which were my fault one at 15 the other at 17 and they said ""well you should of used your brain you can't blame us for your retarded life choices"".
I feel totally helpless, alone, worthless, suicidal, powerless and spend alot of time self loathing...

Sobriety and Work,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1i7a06w/sobriety_and_work/,"So I've been working for an Amazon DSP for almost, if not 2 years straight now. Worked myself right out of homelessness, using the drug program resources as a catalyst to do so.
I had to leave my long term program once I got a job at FedEx in the warehouse while doing uber eats, but it was too much. I was using a rental to live in and do UE until I saved enough to payback the money, but luckily my mother let me use the money to get my own car 
I then used that newly purchased used car to live in and work, this time at a DSP for Amazon. All sounds great right? However in the process I was getting high with a girl I fell for in the program. At the time it felt like I needed all this to keep me sane and okay while living the way I was and too work hard as possible so I wouldn't fail.
Long story short, it's 2 years later and I've been Up and Down tolerance wise but never sober more than maybe 8-10 hours and always doing at least 2-3 bags a day of fet.
This last week I really got into it with my family, it really hit me at my core and made me realize how badly I want to be normal and sober. I'm just tired of not being myself and not being present for every moment of life. It feels like I was in a walking coma for 2 years, and because I drive for a living I can't a stomach I putting any lives at risk, including my own.
This last week has been he'll but everyday I've been doing the tiniest bumps imaginable to stave off withdrawal while trying to prep my mind and body for a full withdrawal. 
What do you guys honestly think? Should I just keep prepping and take a LOA as soon as humanely possible? I was gonna wait until my lease was up, but now I'm considering taking a month maybe a month and half off, but preferably a month (week for Detox/3 weeks at their program upstairs) to get off this once and for all.
I feel like i don't wanna waste the progress I've already made, and their might not be any better time than now.
Anyone have a clue if a month is long enough? I've come off oxys even dope on my own while still working, but never after this long and never after fet so idk what to expect..

As you know at higher doses of tapentadol you can get some dysphoria and irritation.

It’s then like I’ve taken more tapentadol, I don’t necessarily get more euphoria like I might with just oxycodone.

Heroin didn't use to suck
The fent and tranq came and they fucked things up
The dent the dose makes is always never enough
Heroin didn't use to suck
I'm a cuck for these copious 
Piles of powdered opiates
I watch them slide up and down my nose
I've been up shit creek without a canoo
And I think last week I started to stew 
About the way that heroin used to
Fucking kick my ass, hell I've used too
Much for too long, and I'm still strong
But I feel wrong
So this song goes out to the strung out bong breathing
Schlong teasing bastards
That never go faster
It's slow as they come. 
Arrive and nod off after
I'm quite the disaster
You can't look away
The dope is my master
To him I do pray
And the bin where I lay
In the tent, pitched today
Not a fastball, but speed 
With the black tar and weed
And the past I've reprieved
For the cast I've deceived 
With the last to be seen 
Whether I envy green
Or seethe red with indifference 
Bled out significance 
Read out my dissidence
Addiction has existed since
Time immemorial 
Crime it did soar
And we're still at the forefront
Of these fentanyl horcruxes
Bent on destruction
While sent for seduction
Of my pleasure pathways
It's better with hash
Days to weeks, weeks to years
Still I'm in endless fear
Opioids to obituaries
You'll see me here
I'm a lost cause, sunk cost
Nodding off like a drunk. Lost
In the sauce for a long time
But I never made but one dime
Off the shit sad drug rhymes
Always split between ""wanna die"" 
and ""I'm getting high"" 
But I'm getting by, there aren't tears enough to cry
Maybe I'll jump and try to fly
Maybe I'll nod off and forget to try
I am fighting with flight and the question is why",1/21/25 23:54,

Is addiction always indicative of mental issues?,15,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1i6uesh/is_addiction_always_indicative_of_mental_issues/,"I have been thinking about this a lot lately. Obviously addiction is a hallmark feature of mental health issues/disorders.
However… is it possible to develop an addiction simply because you just absolutely love drugs and the way they make you feel? I’ve accomplished a lot for my age and check the boxes for all of society’s indicators of success, but I’ve never really got the same zest out of life that others do. Never felt like celebrating any of my achievements. Drugs just make me feel whole.

The truth is I'm probably going to go back to using h or oc if I can find it for a decent price. It's times like these I wish I lived in Canada where supposedly you can go get diacetyl morphine in a pill form. Anyway, I'm kind of rambling but my life on subs especially the last 6 months has been absolute hell. I did H for a decade with no side effects and I was genuinely happy, yeah I went through hell but at least I didn't feel like I was dying everyday after I took it. I'm not trying to make addiction sound amazing or glorify it, I'm just stating that look at what happens when you put an opiate into a prescription bottle.

"Interesting question I want all of your thoughts so, currently my DOC is Tapentadol, however it’s very low mu affinity has given me an idea.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1i539ys/interesting_question_i_want_all_of_your_thoughts/,"So I boof Tapentadol using the sims position post plunge, I usually use around 100mg, if you boof properly you can get a bioavailability of around 80% this involves laying on ur left side so the drug can’t go up into the upper rectum which sits slightly on the right, so after this for 20/30 mins let’s say 80mg absorbed Tapentadol is in my blood. After researching so much, the best I’ve found is that Tapentadol’s my agonism is 18 x weaker than morphine which means at 80 mg it’s equivalent to roughly 4.44mg of morphine but also doesn’t fully activate the receptor like morphine.
My question is about tramadol and Tapentadol as a mix, so because Tapentadol has negligible serotonin effects there is no chance of serotonin syndrome, it does however increase the reuptake of norepinephrine by around 30-60% depending on dose which is probably why it’s still a decent drug for me even though it’s mu potency is low. 
Now my question is about tramadol, as both of these drugs are relatively cheap, I wanted to see if this would be something that could really boost the opioid part of the high. So we know tramadol is usually 0.1 compared to morphine so 100mg is 10mg of morphine, so I looked into bioavailability and it’s around 70% but then every dose after sort of synergises with what’s left in your body and you’re able to go up to 90% bioavailability. Tramadol if you’re a good or average metaboliser would turn 70mg tramadol into 7/10.5mg of ODSMT which is argued to be 0.5-1x potency of morphine as well as tramadol giving u that nice serotonin reuptake feeling. 
So I was thinking I can get strips of both for super cheap and dose 100mg Tapentadol and then take 100mg tramadol at onset, then add another 100mg of tramadol maybe 30 mins to an hour later.
The thing is this would mean you would have 4.44morphine equivalent in Tapentadol, and then from the first tramadol pill 7/10.5mg ODSMT, and then second tramadol pill with a slightly higher bioavailability would mean you have between 9-13.5, so roughly 16mg-24mg of ODSMT if we compare that with its approximate agonism to mu with morphine it’s either 0.5/1x as good as morphine so let’s take a middle ground of 20mg of ODSMT which could have mu agonism at the equivalent of 10/20mg morphine add our Tapentadol in leads to 14.4-24.4 mu agonism in comparison to morphine. Am I right or am I missing something? Seems like the best of both worlds in a way",1/19/25 17:08,
Any people with harsh mental illnesses have advice on living without opioids?,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1i51cnu/any_people_with_harsh_mental_illnesses_have/,"Mostly people say opioids stand in their way of living a normal life. Somehow for me it's the opposite. Don't get me wrong, they're ruining my life, but only internally. On the outside I can hold a stable job and excell at it, even get compliments from my boss for improving constantly. I keep learning new skills in life and move forward in what I want to be. Unfortunately I have some underlying health problems and Opioids keeping my cough and phlegm in might be fatal for me some day. I have not been healthy for over half a year now and it's getting worse. 
The thing is that without Opioids my mind wages war on my soul. I have some mental illnesses such as cPTSD, Schizotypal Disorder (may be misdiagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia), Avoidant & Borderline Personality Disorder, Depression, Generalized & Social Anxiety Disorder and some more on top of that. I basically tend to use Opioids as my medication for everything. I've tried most kinds of psychiatric stuff so far which didn't really work as expected and recently got kicked out of therapy (in my country you have a max amount of hours you can take until you need a 2 year break or else you need to pay an awful lot).
I can't talk to people normally without them, I can't be disciplined with my passions, and basically my life stops moving. I retreat to other types of avoidance like other drugs or excessive media consumption if no opioids are there.
It feels like my whole life depends on them and life is simply not worth living without them. The medical system was not effective for me, and I tried many different religions and spiritual types of living which all didn't work.

I am not familiar with using street fent - is there a standard procedure to avoid an OD? It seems less likely while on Sublocade and Suboxone, but looking for insight.

Is it normal to experience withdrawal symptoms after tapering off these meds?
Hey everyone,  
I’m 27 and I’ve been dealing with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and a long-term kratom addiction (40-60g/day for six years). I’ve been working on getting clean and have made significant progress. In early December, I was taking the following daily:
- 16mg of Buprenorphine (Suboxone)  
- 300mg of Pregabalin  
- 50-75mg of Sertraline (Zoloft)  
- 300mg of Trittico (Trazodone)  
- 30mg of Buspirone  
- 50-100mg of Betaloc (Beta-blockers)  
- Chlorprothixen when needed
This may sound like a lot, but it helped me get off kratom, which had worsened my anxiety over time. I never misused benzos, taking them only 4-5 times a year for panic attacks before kratom. After a long battle, I finally tapered down using Suboxone and managed to quit kratom.
By early December, I started reducing my medication. I felt dull, tired, emotionally numb, and lacking libido, but things improved a bit. By mid-January, I was down to only 2mg Suboxone and 150mg Wellbutrin (Bupropion). Everything else I had either tapered off or quit entirely. A couple of weeks ago, I had a rough case of COVID, which kept me on sick leave, so I decided to quit the last remnants of Pregabalin (75mg) and Sertraline (25mg). Now, I feel mentally more like myself than I have in years, with real hope for change.
However, it’s been about 8 days since I stopped Sertraline and Pregabalin, and I’m still experiencing some physical symptoms, such as:
- Poor temperature regulation  
- Sweating  
- Feeling like I have a virus  
- Fatigue and dizziness  
- These symptoms improve when I lie down.
Could these symptoms be due to my body adjusting to going from 12 pills a day to just 2 in under two months? Or could it be a lingering effect of having had COVID recently? Also, I’ve been on Wellbutrin for 11 days, and I haven’t felt any improvement yet—only discomfort. I’ve seen a doctor, and they assured me it’s not serotonin syndrome or anything too concerning.
My next step is tapering off the 2mg of Suboxone, but after reducing from 16mg to 2mg and coming off all these meds, I feel confident I can handle it. Has anyone had a similar experience with tapering meds this drastically? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks so much!

I was healthy bloodwork was ok too.
 Couldnt find any gear anymore. And that was the beginning of the end..
So i was sober again.. and i started to cry and so shit again. Everything seems to be meaningless. Everything is allright..everything is fine.. i go to work, im getting good Marks at school. I nearly dont train and i dont give a fuck about my Diet.. Im getting weaker anyways in a rapide speed. Ive lost 5.5kg in 7 weeks... and ive lost so much strenght all gone away. But thats not the point. 
So being sober is an absolute nightmare. Im criying  and so shit.. but icw still work and school.. 
So instand of criying i started drinking alcohol at work. Before the work in the mornkng, in the lunchbreak, evening, non stop a lil bit 1 2 drinks herein and there... not getting drunk but all the time
After that i thaught to myself ive to change something. If i drink all day for longer ill get an alcoholic. So Switched to taking opiods. Most of the time tilidin.  Started with 250mg (for 10 years it was always so im pain patient, have scoliosis) that was my whole life my golden Spot. It was enough. 
Than, while wrestling, i felt down to the right, but my right foot was still on the ground. My Training Partner caught me but i still fucked up my right foot. Was forced to be at home the whole time. And i got really immense pain and being home the whole time and not having anything to do drives me crazy. And the doc didnt allow me to train with a good reason (my foot). So i went higher in the dosage.
Now im working again.. and do everything too but still not Training more than once a werk or so.. then i consumed in 2 days 50mg tramadol 450mg tapentadol and some dhc dont know the dosage. And couldnt get anything more. 
First day was ok i felt a lil bit weak. 
2nd day i understoood that im (opiods)addicted again.(the last time it was before 8 years or so).
(Ive to be in the train for 4 hours everyday and that diverse me vrazy ive to move my msucles have spastics and that males me also aggressive) 
Day 3 i Went crazy in the night. Got some Monet from my lil sister 10 euros and bought me woth that 5 oxy 5mg. And ive Finished them in 12 hours. That was thursday. I went to my doc and dxplained him that im addicted and that i dont know what to. That i need help bc of my ptsd and now fucking opiod addiction. I said to him that my daily dosage would be 400mg of tildin per day and that i go higher by the day and that my consume has nothing tobdo with pain its bc i cry if not i cant do it without.  He gave me 1 100mg tilidin and 8 150mg. After that i bought 1mg xanax and 5x5mg oxys too. 
My doc said to me i should Visit him than i need help or than something happened. And i should Tell him than ive holidays. So he could send me to psychotherapy for ptsd and (opiid)Turkey. Which ive in june 😭. On wednesday ive my free day this week so i can Visit him than again. 
Yesterday i gave a really bad friend (since first grade or even vefore)  2 of the tildin. Snd he still asks me for tilidik and i only habe 2 left)Hes addicted too (he was always coke and gambling addicted)his father died beodre a few months ago and he took fentanyl and nearly everything. Yesterday i took something like 15mg oxys and 300 tildin. 😭😭. Yesterday i worked and my foot started to hurt again even oxys didnt reduce the pain as needed (ive to walk and ''run'' the whole day. And i dont want to not go to work bc were 3 workers in my department, so if someone is missing its most likely the other ones have to work alone and thats hard. 
Today i had free.In that night i slept for 13 hrs. And after waking up i ate for 2hrs. So i only had half of the day to consume and i still Manager to use 300mg tilis and 5mg oxys. And my foot still hurts. I took my 150 tilli in the ''morning''. Than now 1 oxy and after that i still nearly cried and so i took 150mg tllidin again and i still want to take one more..😢(and my foot still hurted till now.) 
I dont want it anymore.. thats no condition. Fucking hardcore opiod addic. Fucking Junky. I hate myself. I hate the World. I hate the System and everything else. I want to end it but i wont😢😢. I need help. Im fucked. I dont know what to do how to survive. And I will go highher in dosage.. ive no money.. i get 800 per month.  I go fuckinf higher in dosage and higher. I know that i  should go down and i wamt to and want to come off at least from opioids, not from steroids (they make my life surviveble they give it structure without im absolute Chaos ive not adhd im adhd, but i cant. I cant without them..( or gear) the other options would be alcoholic (that would be the worst option). And other option (cant be done, opiod addict is far better) is getting back on antidepressants and antipsychotics (i wont i would rather die) bc of the side Effekts and their absurdly brutal withdrawl ( i would rather quit opiods 100 Times cold than once that shit). Once i had non of them and i felt like dying. That would be ok but not in that way. With Cramps and in delirium for 3 days in vacation. That was hard. And their fucking nasty sideeffects. Antidepressants make me dont come.. no matter how hard i try after going and doing the craziest shit maybe it will happen with a lot of luck after 2 hours or so... and fucking antipsychotics give me the most brutal rls and spastics known to human race.(i quit zhem 5 years ago (with psychedelics and without any withdrwl and i still have Bad rls from them therefor i didnt had that shit) Yes they knock me the fuck out at first but than after bildung up some tolerante im awake enough to feel the fucking spasms and rls. Im than like on waay tonmuch xtc.and that shit makes me stupid as fuck. Its neurotic as hell and i dont want to loose even more intellience than ive already done. Im still far more  intelligent than most of other humans, but i refuse to take fucking antidepressants and antipsychotics and getting more stupid. In my Look at the World and phylosophy its a big crime against humanity, human rights, freedom.. that they force me not to take gear(so i can get my life together)  and what is even a much bigger crime is that they force me to take antipsychotics and antidepressants. Even than i say that i dont want them. Im even rattert be a  junky a fucking opiod addict than doing These to groups again. Im rattert dead than using antidepressants antipsychotics again. Its the worst thing ti be on. Why they have to make my life so hard i could take gear and at least come off everything else.. and they dont want me to be on opiods either.. they will me to quit opids and start with my so hated antidepressants and antipsychotics again bc they fuck my life makes me so addicted that i most likely will neuer come off them and they make me stupid and a stupid Population is easy to Control.

**Quick History to provide context**
   
**Feb 2nd 2024**: went cold turkey and stayed clean for a few months. During that withdraw I vomited on day 5 only and otherwise it was only diarrhoea quite bad..  
June 2024: relapsed on my habit but even higher mg of oxycontins and oxycodone sandoz + up to 2000mg of lyrica every single day.   
   
10 days ago: went cold turkey oxy and lyrica. It was HELL. Now I’ve started taking fucking lyrica in the last 2 days and I took oxy 2 days ago and zero withdrawal symptoms and then took a bit more today…. 
     
  
If the worst of it is over (I vomited for 4 days straight and the diarrhoea holy hell thank god I had a waterproof mattress cover but I was so unwell I was timing the vomiting it was literally between 5-20 minute intervals and lasted for like 4-6 days straight and shitting the bed and stuff was dreadful. I was so weak and dizzy and sick I just gave up knowing I would need to wash EVERYTHING.   
  
I’m not gonna lie to was a really
Traumatic withdrawal I did not think it would be that bad because the first time I went cold turkey I only vomited on day and j thought that was hell (I have emetophobia which is fear of vomiting lol)( 
But yeah I obviously still have very bad pain which is the reason I take oxycodone etc in the first place.. today my back was in agony so I took some instant release oxynorms 50mg of those but being instant release they only lasted like 2 hours… so then I got my slow releases OxyContin and have taking a 30mg & 20mg. I feel fuuucked up. Right before I quit I was taking 240mg with 2100mg lyrica (pregablin) just to try and feel and I couldn’t feel anything I wouldn’t nod nothing.  
  
Today on the 50mg slow release I’ve taken I’m nodding so much and feel completely fucked up.  
   
But I’m also scared that I’m going to be vomiting again.   
   
Should I “taper” off using the 5mg instant release I’ve got?  
   
  
Or will I be okay considering it was ONE DAY. And no I will not take anymore blah blah blah because I’m so stressed beyond belief about how bad the withdrawal is I can’t believe I took them but now I’ve scared myself completely off them. I’m terrified of those withdraws I’ve never felt thag sick in my life I thought I was doing to die.  
    
  
Thank you to anyone who can answer. Yea it’s dumb to take them STRAIGHT after coming off them cold turkey I know I know I am so stupid and have so much regret and now anxiety I do not want to vomit again.   
  
**TL;DR**. 
Went cold turkey off pharma grade oxycodone & lyrica (240mg oxy, 2100mg+ lyrica daily) had a very traumatic withdraw of vomiting and shitting for 5 days straight. Now a few days later I took oxy and a little lyrica because pain and I wanted a little relief at the tail end of my withdraw.. then had a day of no oxy but some lyricas, I just then I took more oxy today. My tolerance is extremely lowered (I’ve taken 40mg instant which was strong but then I took some long lasting ones 50Mg and I’m absolutely fucked like nodding really hard etc…. Crazy because 14 days ago 240mg did nothing and now 50mg has me fucked up. Anyway I have a vomiting phobia and I am terrified of vomitng again. I am so so so scared and I have learned my fucking lesson to never touch this shit again due to the fear I have right now..  
   
Please tell me that I will be okay? Has anyone ever  basically “relapsed” or used STRAIGHT after detoxing and been thrown straight back in to the withdraws?  Or is it gonna be okay because I’ve technically withdrawn so this is like I’ve taken it for first time or whatever.
  
  
Fuck I’m so stupid I’m so scared. THANK you <3 ",1/18/25 7:36,

A friend told me to try the Press’d 30 mg hulks. So today, I went and bought them and took all three tablets. I wasn’t expecting much because my tolerance to oxycodone is so high. I thought, there’s no way these tablets compare to oxycodone.
But, dude, tell me why these three tablets hit way harder than the 120 mg of oxy I took yesterday—and the buzz lasted way longer. Now I get why people take 7-hydroxy. I did have to take some Zofran to combat the nausea, but, Jesus Christ, those tablets slapped so hard.

To start with I'm constantly feeling disrespected by pretty much everyone that comes in my life, from managers/coworkers to even friends.
2nd thing is I'm so lonely, recently got out of a really toxic situationship(she was a narcissist who spread lies and rumours about me) especially when she couldn't get her way. I tend to attract those types of people, maybe I give off a weak vibe which makes people feel like they can get away with treating me like shit. ( Which they can unfortunately).
 I guess a part of my drug usage comes from wanting to feel loved and appreciated but I've genuinely never experienced that feeling even from my own family, I overheard my mother once say "" he was an accident"" which may have caused some of the abuse mostly physical and emotional in early childhood.
I just feel like my whole life is a struggle and feeling inadequate, chasing this feeling of love so hard that I've lost myself in the process.
I genuinely don't know what to do and the oxy has such a grip on my life I hate it, but at the same time it's the only thing that gives me some relief and to be able to get through the day.

I kind of enjoy oxy by itself even though the high was way better when combined with weed. The hallucinations could have also been caused by lack of sleep.

I am going to answer most of what you guys need to know so you don’t end up sick for hours. First, for a first time user I would crush the pill up and snort little lines at a time and work your way upto a buzz you enjoy. Sublingual is much harder to divide depending if your pill has slits or not, you could end up very sick. Do not snort more than maybe 0.5mg - 1mg for your first time or you will most likely get sick. I take 25-50mg promethazine with it to ease some of the opiate nausea, usually I don’t get sick at all if I throw promethazine into the mix.

""There are several important study results. First, crushed OxyContin was rapidly absorbed by the IN route and was reliably detected in plasma within 5 minutes of dosing. Second, OxyContin had high intranasal bioavailability: 78% and 75% after 15 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg, respectively. Third, the t1/2 of IN OxyContin was approximately 3.5 hours and was not statistically different than the t1/2 of 3.3 hours for IV oxycodone.

It's not normal tramadol, it was just called ODSM tramadol or something (red pills, didn't come in a packaging). They are 200mg extended release pills and therefore stronger than the normal ones.

Withdrawal / sub induction,2,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1i38idx/withdrawal_sub_induction/,"
Friends, without going in to too much meaningless detail, I have found myself taking 240 mg of oxy day, with roughly 2/3 of that that being taken at 8 or 9 at night. I work tomorrow (1/17) but I don't have to go back until (1/22 - next Wednesday).
As far as comfort meds go I have:
2 - 8mg subs
15 -  1mg alprazolam
15 - 300 mg gabapentin
30 loperamide. 
Tomorrow (Friday 1/17) I plan to take only 180 mg of oxy, but I need advice in inducing on subs and coming up with a plan on taking AS LITTLE SUB AS POSSIBLE. I am thinking that Saturday I will take 3mg. Sunday 2mg. Monday 1mg and drop from there.  
I am familiar with the COWS scale and plan to wait 24 hours until I take my first subs dose, but making it to 24 hours is the difficult part.  Can anyone provide advice about that? When do I take the gaba? How much?
Any and all advice would be much appreciated.  I'd like to free once again. However, I'm not taking Kratom, I'm not interested in long term sub use, and I won't take subs for more than 4 days.  ",1/17/25 4:36,

Took kratom a couple times after my workout and it's definitely enjoyable, but the kratom interferes with my sleep and doesn't seem to add anything substantial to how I already feel, so I quit doing it after workout.
Can only recommend a good training session for that natural opioid high!

The video is 10 yrs old now and from what i know,Nalu and Jango are from Hawaii,is it even possible that 10yrs ago they were smoking fake M30s?
Im not American and idk how the opioid situation was 10yrs ago.
From what i know,its impossible to smoke real Oxys,they will just catch fire on the foil and the pill will not slide like heroin or other smokeable substances.

Tired of my daughters not living like normal people because they have functioning addict for a mother. Tired of not being a good example. Tired of feeling so useless I wanna od. Just tired. 
I blocked everyone and every time I think about them I get so damn angry. They tripped over themselves to supply me even when Id ask them not to.  When i blocked the number they called from other phones. When i moved over an 1 1/2 away, they volunteered to drive to me.  That's what happens when you pay fast, buy the most, and you include a tip if they come by you first. You're the preferred customer and they know your weakness. Every time I told them I was done they'd call just to ""check on me"" and slyly let me know they had something in case I needed a little something and I always gave in just like they knew I would. Not this fuckin time. 
Honestly there this old perverted guy that gets 180 10mg percs and he lives for the times I have no money.  The 18 months after I met him I found myself doing  things I cried about later and every time was the last time. He actually hates when i have money.  I'm upset with myself about that. I miss the woman I was. She would never. I feel like calling his Dr and telling them to do a pill count on his ass but im not a hater and I believe in karma. 
Please wish me luck and strength. I have my moments every day but I try to make myself wait 15 minutes before I place any calls and then i use that time to talk myself off the ledge or watch one of the many videos I have of me crying and begging MYSELF to stop killing me.  It's been working so far.  When I told myself even if I slip once I can get back on track, I thought I was giving myself a pass and miraculously I didn't take it. I don't know how but I didnt. I could call 5 different people now but I haven't. No clear reason why not, i just haven't. I'm so proud of that. 
Been in addiction since 2008 and have never gone a full week without pills.  At one time I was taking (10) 10/325 perc or norcos at once like 3xs a day.. I don't know why I'm not dead. When I did have a script of 60 I'd be out in 2 days. I also had a physical last week of December and even after 16 years and thousands and thousands of pills with acetaminophen my liver is OK too. I couldn't believe when my Dr said that.  That also aids me in choosing better. Feels so weird to have spending money again. THAT is the biggest oddity to me.
Edited: thanks to anybody who made it this far. A kind redditor told me to break it up inti paragraphs and I did that. I know the grammar and sentence structure is atrocious and I apologize but I'm not good with that and I just wanted to get it all out.",1/15/25 6:00,

Naturally high tolerance?,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1i1efck/naturally_high_tolerance/,"I recently started getting back into opiates after a rather long break. I had been using poppy seed tea very successfully for several years when the quality was much better and they were widely available. The feeling and pain relief was amazing. When I was a teenager I also dabbled in hydros, oxys, and opana when they were available and always really enjoyed the feeling. 
For a the last few months I have been picking up pharma oxy dolors and mundis (80 MG ER) and taking them both orally and snorting them after either crushing them up (chewing) or using a wet paper towel to remove the outside coating and then crushing and snorting or just swallowing. The feeling I am getting is very muted and I wonder if people can develop a natural tolerance oxy or if I’m doing something inefficient when I take them. My first dose of the day hits okay for 1-2 hours and if I wait 5-8 hours after I am usually able to redose and get an even more mild feeling of euphoria. I am taking 1-3 80 mg pills at a time.
Most recently I had been off the oxy mundis for 2 weeks before picking up another order and even after being off them for two weeks (was taking Kratom during those weeks) the feeling is a bit of a let down compared to the cost. 
I started taking Zoloft earlier this year. I wonder if that could be blocking the effects at all? Is there anything else that could be causing resistance to the euphoric feeling of opiates given that when I was younger I had no problem feeling great after a few 5 mg hydros. Since they are ER is there a better way to ingest them other than just crushing them up?
In theory these are real pharmas and I get them from a reputable source which I trust and does a lot of volume. I have an order out for #4 H so will see how that feels. I really miss the euphoria and relief I got from PST but my sense is that market just isn’t going to recover to a place where I can get seeds like I had been in 2015-2020.",1/14/25 19:37,

Anyone tried Opium Vapes?,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1i17wnq/anyone_tried_opium_vapes/,"I just saw some for sale online and they were quite intriguing but I'm pretty skeptical that a vape pen would be able to heat it up to the correct temp without burning half of it.
I smoked/ate a gram of Opium almost a year ago and I think it took almost a full gram to feel anything so I assume I'd need to vape an entire cartridge for a buzz lol.
Still intriguing though as I like the thought of just puffing away at it all day, mainly for staving off withdrawals and satisfying my oral fixation. And for the record, my oral fixation is a result of vaping, definitely not sucking off random dudes, you dirty minded mfers. I'm a responsible adult. I keep bungee cords within arms reach at all times, as all flexible man should).
I personally think opium is pretty overrated (if you've tried pretty much any other opiate/opiod) and overpriced anyways but I assume it feels pretty nice if you have no tolerance. 
Anyways, sorry for the tangent. I want to know what you guys think about the feasibility of using a vape pen to smoke opium? I had my doubts about DMT pens are but those turned out okay, I just think DMT is much more susceptible to overheating. An electric nectar collector did work okay for me though so who knows. Pretty mixed reviews on the vape listing as well so kind of reluctant.
On the other hand, what's even the point of having money if not to spend it on novel drug delivery systems? Those were actually the last words my friend said before OD'ing so It seems disrespectful not to try it. Afterall I was the one who pulled the boof syringe out of his cold dead ass and hid (read: did) all his drugs and deleted his search history. 
They're relatively inexpensive but seems like a better idea to just buy a full gram for slightly more and use a better vaporizer or nectar collector.

A link to a paper where a patient was given a fistula for IV drug use.
I don't know how much thought has been given to it, but man, sign me up. I know it's kind of fucked up for a relatively healthy person to want a fistula to shoot up into, and I don't doubt it is without risks and downside, but it would be more than a game changer, for people who use IV and aren't seeking to quit. 
With a fistula, you could hit first time, every time, not worrying about slipping out or missing any of the shot. You could feel confident that you are getting the full dose... You could stop halfway, decide if you want to do the rest, without worrying about slipping out. 
Most importantly, you aren't destroying vein after vein and/or progressing towards jugular and femoral site injections... No abscesses from missed shots, and this next one is huge: The amount of time saved, not to mention the stress, pain, frustration, and wasted drugs from struggling to hit...
Yeah it sounds kinda extreme, but for someone who isn't interested in quitting, for various circumstances, I feel this would be a game changer for so many of us.

"Advice for synthetic opioids WD, meds I have to use to help...",8,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1i142ng/advice_for_synthetic_opioids_wd_meds_i_have_to/,"Hello everyone,
I recently spoke to an addiction Dr. and talked with him about options for at home WD, he was opposed to it and really wanted me to either A. go to a clinic and get methadone daily or B. get blood work and piss test done to get on subs. I told him I was against both as they WDs I've heard are way worse than any opioids and hurt much worse (twice as long duration, slower half life as I know).
He was opposed to at home WD but he said only because the long term effects don't do anything to fight against the mental cravings or the chance of relapse is much higher. I didn't argue with him but long story short I convinced him to prescribe his *""At Home Withdrawal Kit""* which composed of the following...
* **Trazodone** 50 MG tablets. Qty: 20
* **Gabapentin** 300 MG capsules. Qty 30
* **Ondansetron** HCL aka Zofran 4 MG tablets. Qty 10
* **Clonidine** 0.1 MG/24 HR WEEKLY. Qty 1 Transdermal Patch (this dosage seems low but a patch is kinda nice not to worry about for 7 days)
My Mom also knows I will be going into WD in the next 12 hours and gave me **Duloxetine** (Cymbalta) HCL 20 MG capsules Qty 17. The other med is called **Clonazepam** (Klonopin) 0.5 MG tablet, Qty 22.
I just wanted to know besides the Doctors recommendations if anyone has some good advice on what to take that will help (I don't need to describe the WD effects, everyone knows the main ones *RLS, temp control, anxiety, insomnia, etc...*). I will start WD around 6-9 hours from now. I tried looking it up and descriptions didn't help much but for all these meds do I need to wait X amount of time since last opioid dosage to take any of the WD meds?
The stuff my Mom gave to help out, she mentioned one of them, I can't remember honestly which one, I could ask her but she said one of them helps you be happier...? She said that I am not sure either the Klonopin or Cymbalta but she said those will help me in WDs, maybe someone can chime in.
  
Oh forgot to mention, if anyone cares as to why I believe this is the worst WD ever for me and worse than any typical Norco, Perc, m30, etc... WD. Is because I discovered what they swapped as a opiate in the m30s, instead of the typical oxy used it was swapped with **Protonitazene** (A Synesthetic Opioid) first made in the 50s. It is incredibly strong, they say stronger than fent and I really enjoyed how long it lasted. For example, 1 pill would literally last me 12 hours or so, not high that whole time but no like WD feeling or anything like that just felt normal. Anyway that is what I am 95% sure is in it, and that is why the WD is so intense.
Any questions I'll do my best to respond asap but the longer the wait till a question appears the more into WD I'll probably be, spare me the criticism. 
Thank you everyone for reading my long ass post, sorry I ramble on sometimes, just skip over it if its too much lol.
Take care,

Equivalency of Hydromorphone and Heroin?,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1i13zro/equivalency_of_hydromorphone_and_heroin/,"Just curious about the equivalency of Hydromorphone and Heroin. 
How much Hydromorphone (oral) is equal to high quality #4 Heroin (~90% diacetylmorphine, insufflated) on a milligram per milligram basis?
Just looking for an approximation if possible, doesn't need to be super accurate.
After some quick research it seems like based on their potency in comparison to morphine, and factoring in the bioavailability of each method (oral vs. intranasal), that there wouldn't be much difference in their potency in terms of weight. 
But I've also heard people say Heroin is way stronger on a miligram per miligram basis so I'm a bit confused. The math seems fairly simple but I'm also pretty dumb so not sure.
Or maybe they just can't be compared quite that easy because of the unique effect of diamorphine on the brain compared to most other opiods? ",1/14/25 11:26,

Opiates bucket list?,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1i072v7/opiates_bucket_list/,"To keep it short- 
WHATS YOUR OPIATES BUCKET LIST?
(a list of opiates you would someone “recommend” to try) 
Hi guys, I am pretty new to opiates even though I am experienced with other drugs. Somehow I always had mad respect of opiates and avoided them, because my uncle was an addict and died of it. 
So now I old enough (27) to experiment here and there. 
I tried:
1. Poppy tea - did not understand the high
2. Codeine pills - did not understand the high
3. Tramadol - did not work for me
4. Codeine/DPH syrup- nice high, but not for the price…
5. Kratom (I know opioid , not opiate) - did not understand the high 
6. Oxy - surprisingly really nice high, but expensive where I live 
So apparently my body does not process opiates “well”, as I did not even feel high off most opiates I tried. Only oxy “worked” for me. People tell me, that I am lucky, that my body is like this. 
I was losing hope and thinking opiates are just not for me. But that oxy experience gave me hope. 
So besides things I’ve already tried , I wanna try someday:
1. Tilidin - most accessible where I live
2. “True” Opium - people from country of my origin just do cook it themselves and say it’s the best opiates you can get
3. Diaphin- medical grade heroin, might even happen someday, since I live in Europe 
4. Buprenorphine - some of my friends said, that’s the 🐐
5. Hydromorphone- lucky that I might get some, since friend gets its prescribed. 
6. Oxymorphone - tbh I think I’ll never get some, where I live, but maybe someday. 
7. O-DSMT - shits even legal and lab produced where I live, heard it’s even better than tramadol, since tramadol is metabolised to O-DSMT. 
8. Morphine - the OG
9. Omnopon - not even sure if it’s still being produced, but heard that’s a goat (to keep it short is a combination of different alcaloids)

Rn I’ve got twitches + spasms + chills + aches + increased heart rate, insomnia. 
I’ve found that tapering down your opiate use before you run out is the best option and only take the smallest amounts just enough to make you not feel sick until you run out then by the 24-72 hrs I’m good to start micro inducing subs.

Withdrawal Help,7,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hzryge/withdrawal_help/,"Ok, so i've never done a post before so please bare with me.
Been on 30mg of oxy and 30mg of morphine sulf ER for 10 years. Started because of cancer and then continued with a pain clinic after the year of chemo. I've never bought illegally or done anything street related, every time i get a prior auth or back ordered medication i've dealt with it, done the withdrawal and go back once its available again. But god i'm tired guys... I'm tired of putting my life on hold, I got married during a prior auth and withdrawals. Should have been the happiest day of my life but i was so miserable.
Every time I stop, I make it 2-3 weeks without the medicine. The withdrawals aren't too bad, yeah im uncomfortable, I sneeze 50 times a day for weeks, diarrhea for weeks, low energy, cravings, you name it... but the worst is the sense of emptiness I feel. NOTHING and i mean NOTHING gives me joy. after 3 weeks of not being able to do anything i did before, i'm completely unable to keep myself off the meds. My favorite thing to do, me and my wife will game together. We have matching ""battle stations"" and pc game all the time. We've been doing it for 10 years, I don't take the medicine to get high, that hasn't happened in like 10 years since i started, i only take it to feel normal. I CANNOT play video games and enjoy myself. I cant sit through a movie. I get a small inkling of ""I should do this, it would be fun."" then as fast i got the feeling it vanishes and im not interested or cant enjoy it.
every time i go back to the medicine its like 21 days or so. Something hits me around 3 weeks, I just have fatigue. I miss video games, miss movies, miss doing fun things with my wife. It feels like i'll never be happy again.
TLDR: I guess my question is when will I feel happy again? I can't find fun in the things me and my wife used to do to relax. Should I try antidepressants? or should i not trade one medicine for another? I just wish their was a timeline on this, i truly want be normal again.",1/12/25 17:34,

And that was by far the most unpleasant feeling I've ever had. I've been through multiple major surgeries and really bad acid trips and benzo withdrawals.  But even when those are combined, the narcan took the cake when it came to pain and suffering. 
If you have experienced both PWD and naloxone/narcan(same thing, just differentways to be administered) , what would you say is worse?
I would assume that PWD is not as bad as narcan,  because if it's suboxone or methadone that causes the PWD than, that means you still have some sort of opioid on your opioid receptors, maybe it's not the same amount of opioids or type. But still, some receptors are being turned on. While with narcan,  it nearly strips all the opioids off of the receptors.

PWD while on an airplane plane for 5 hours…. Horror story & how I survived 😂 (precipitated withdrawal for searchers),54,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hzjvdz/pwd_while_on_an_airplane_plane_for_5_hours_horror/,"I had to share this and thought someone might learn something or get a laugh. My fiancé and I just got back from Costa Rica. We’re planning our wedding down there. My DN package didn’t arrive in time so I was stuck with MINIMAL supply but thought I had enough to make it. Of course, my dope brain set in while on the trip and said “have fun, your on vacation, get high and the last day, Saturday, you can just take subs” So that’s what I did and we had an amazing vacation for the first 5 days, on day 6 I didn’t take any dope/fent and just used OxyContin thinking that would help me avoid PWDs. NOPE, boy was I wrong….
I waited and took the suboxone at the airport when I couldn’t take the regular withdrawal any longer. IMMEDIATELY I knew I made a mistake. I felt ice rush through my veins and within 30 minutes I was sent into a hell I didn’t know existed and should only be saved for the worst of human kind (which I like to think I am not). I was shaking, sweating uncontrollably, my arms and legs felt like they were going to break in half, I was nauseous…. and oh, I had to board a plane for a 5 hour flight back to NY and then a 5 hour drive back home! I told my fiancé I must have gotten food poisoning but it was by far the most insane plane ride I’ve ever taken, shaking, crying, I wanted to jump out and die so badly. Somehow I managed to reach deep within my mind and so this crazy meditation that was almost an out of body experience and would last ~20 minutes at a time before being sent back into withdrawal and reality. But that was the only way I was able to make it without taking the whole plane down and making an even bigger scene. Deep breathing and just digging so fucking deep and accepting this was my reality and I need to deal with it. But that plane ride was awful. Like the worst acid trip in the world and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. Then I had to drive 5 hours him which I managed to do solely because I knew I had more dope at home to save me. After about a half g to take me out of precip withdrawal I’m feeling good enough to look back and laugh and post this for anyone who is thinking of going on vacation …. Make sure you either have enough drugs or are already indicted on subs or risk being absolutely FUCKED by the hand of god or the devil or whoever punishes dope fiends like I was

I have no income, and nobody really that I can ask to buy me any or share with me. They're rare. Where I live, fent is the main drug, so if I wanted to get any for a reasonable price it's just be fent and that ain't my vibe. I also can't buy crypto, cuz I use an online bank account (I got scammed a while back and lost my bank, and can't easily get a new one for a couple years). 
So basically, if I want to use, I have to jump through a bunch of hoops or get really fuckin lucky, but the one friend I even have that does drugs with any consistency doesn't do opiates (I got my current bottle of hydros from them, they got some for free but they're on sublocade).

I'm down to 11 vicodin, 10/325, and I'm saving them for a rainy day, but goddamn I wish I could even get just like half a gram of (non-fent) h.

Clean, play games, make art, i can do whatever. I'm clear-headed, calm, empathetic. Usually it's really hard to have sex for me but when I'm on that cloud, it's pretty easy, and really fun. What I wouldn't give, just for a month's supply. I guess that's why they're so dangerous.

Propranolol seriously helps WD symptoms,6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hzfzow/propranolol_seriously_helps_wd_symptoms/,"I heard about Propranolol from a friend about it reducing WD symptoms. I was naturally skeptical but it really does work. I was averaging around 300mg a day of pharma oxy and when I’d run out I’d have severe WD’s. I would be so anxious/agitated that I couldn’t even sit down, I’d just walk in laps around the house. I’d be pouring sweat even with the aircon blaring at 20°C (68°F).
I tried taking 40mg of propranolol one day when having severe WD’s and within an hour they all but disappeared. It got rid of at least 90% of my WD symptoms. I could sit still and watch TV and my anxiety was greatly reduced. I wasn’t bucketing sweat and I felt almost human. If 40mg doesn’t work you can bump it up to 80mg.
If you combine this with Imodium (loperamide) for the diarrhoea and Buscopan (hyoscine butylbromide) for the stomach pains then you can ride out your WD’s with minimal discomfort. I came off 300mg of pharma oxy a day and with this combo my WD’s were reduced by at least 80-90%.
You’ll need a prescription for propranolol in most places but just find an online/phone doctor and tell them your usual doctor gives it to you for high blood pressure (make sure you’re honest with them about any medications you’re taking and your medical history to ensure it’s safe for you to take). Most doctors will give it to you without hesitation as it’s not a controlled medication and it’s relatively safe to take.

I started taking hydrocodone around October of 2023 it quickly spiraled into a poly substance addiction. I have always smoked weed that’s nothing new however every substance I mention in this post this was my first major exposure to them! I started for quite a few reasons to keep it short for this post one of the main reasons I was I had an accident and most of my tooth was gone exposing the nerve to the elements! The pain wasn’t terrible it was just the lack of sleep and how uncomfortable I always felt. So occasionally I would take 10mg of hydrocodone to help with those problems quickly I realized why people threw their lives away for a pill and it became a very common thing for me to do 10 went to 20,40,60 etc you get it. I was always chasing that original high never achieved that!! After around a year of of jumping face first into the realm of drugs I went to the psych ward. 
For two weeks I experienced withdrawals from opioids,opiates,benzos while I was in the hospital. I thought that’s this would be the first and last time I’d ever experience those feelings. I had willingly gone and seriously wanted to turn my life around but I wasn’t ready. Quickly after getting out started stockpiling substances as I was taking 12 of Suboxone for several months. Two months of Suboxone withdrawal later I was back at it it’s been around 3 months since I quite. I used Xanax and Valium during those few months this is important because when I started again my benzo tolerance was decent nothing crazy tho. As I got back into my routine of taking drugs my tolerance went right back to where it was and I thought maybe it’s the benzos well I decided cold turkey them and fuck me was that a bad idea. So a few more weeks of just lots of anxiety and stress. This whole time I’ve been prescribed quite a few different medications None of which were opioids or benzos! I was on Prozac,clonidine and Seroquel throughout most this time about a week ago I had to stop taking my Seroquel. This has caused me to shake uncontrollably since and I have full body RLS I have slept maybe 8 hours total since I stopped!
I have spent two years either doing anything in my power to get high or dealing with withdrawals that made me wanna do unspeakable things! I have ruined relationships lost trust in most of my family and friends. I’ve had health issues from it and still I crave that high more than I crave life itself and I mean that.

It would never happen to me...Loperamide post,48,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hyngoi/it_would_never_happen_to_meloperamide_post/,"I have seen a couple of posts on here lately that reference people being on loperamide/ immodium and I wanted to give you an account of my experience. 
I will never forget the day I discovered Immodium. I read all this stuff about it on the forums back in 2014-15 era and decided to do some research on Wikipedia. 
  
ChemSpider data...Discovered in....oh there it is!! Drug class -
  
Drug Class- Opioid Agonist. 
  
Opioid?! 
  
I thought this \*mimicked\* opioids? I thought it was an opioid that didnt cross the blood brain barrier, which made it sort of less of an opioid? I did not realize I was dealing with a full fledged Opioid agonist. 
  
A few days later, it was a wednesday, and I got paid Thurdsay. I decided to go down to the local publix and steal a couple of boxes of Immodium. I knew that I had to take quite a few, so I really over did it. I took 60 pills of Immodium. 
  
As I hung out on my couch browsing reddit, the familiar opioid warmth took a hold of me. My eyes got tighter, I was scratching my nose more. Smoking cigarettes every ten minutes. But I did not know what I was in for until the next day. 
  
The next morning I woke up and was high as a kite!! Full blown opioid high!! I thought I had discovered the holy grail. A legal opiod that could be stolen, that gave me a legitimate high was available at every single grocery store in my city. They say that it does not pass the blood brain barrier...Ah yes, this is true if taken in minimal amounts. If you take a lot...in my experience 50 or more pills...It definitely crosses the BBB. 
  
Time went by, I used it as a crutch, until I found myself in rehab. Times had gotten bad, I had a schedule 1 drug arrest under my belt and was legally mandated to a rehab. The dope had turned into fentanyl by this time (2018) and when I entered my mandated treatment, it didnt take 60 pills to get me high...it took 200. 
Days turned into weeks in this facility, weeks turned into months and by month 3 of this place I was taking 300 (yes 300) immodium pills per day. I was about 30 pounds overweight, I was nodding out at my desk at cushy office job where people didn't nod out, I was getting these electrical zaps in my body that would shake my arms and legs violently and my skin was extremely dry from the immodium induced dehydration. Also, I was drinking about 2 gallons of water a day to keep myself hydrated. My coworkers would make comments to me like ""bro I have NEVER seen someone drink that much water...you might need to get yourself looked at"" , "" Do you have diabetes man?"" 
One day, a Friday, I was walking across the office and felt a shock and a sense of impending doom. Thats the only way I know how to describe it. IT stopped me in my tracks, I still remember where I wa standing in that office when it happened. Like... I all of a sudden knew something bad was going to happen and went into a panic. The whole rest of the day I felt off...I felt like something was about to go really wrong. 
  
 I had heard all of these problems with immodium and heart issues...I was constantly checking my pulse over the course of these months. This night I checked my pulse like normal...nothing.No, I mean I couldnt feel anything, there was not a pulse to be found. I began to panic, I did not have a pulse. I would press my fingers to my neck, feel where my heart is on my chest, and couldnt feel anything!! I booked an appointment for a suboxone doctor the next day. 
  
I go to the appointment the next day and on the way home from the pharmacy, I am walking to the top of a hill and feel myself blacking out, it felt like tunnel vision.  ""Uh oh- somethings wrong"", I said. I called my girlfriend and she comes to see me. I put on her apple watch....164 BPM- not good. 
  
We sped down to the hospital, They rush me inside and do an EKG, my shits haywire. Ventricular Tachycardia. The try multiple medicines, one stops your heart and restarts it, (feels like shooting coke without euphoria), and another one. Nothing was working. Doctors were running around, my bed was surrounded by 10-15 doctors and nurses. They had a look of panic on their face. 
  
They rushed me up to ICU and began to explain things, 
  
""Sir, I dont know if you understand whats going on, but its not looking good. You should call your family and tell them to come see you. We will be doing a cardioversion in a few minutes"" 
  
I declined to call my family. 
""Sir...I dont think you understand...Call your family now"" 
  
Again I declined. 
  
I always thought they would be more nice and understanding like in the movies. They were all very matter of fact and told my what I didn't want to hear. 
They told me they were giving me fentanyl citrate and would induce the cardioversion, which honestly, I was stoked on. 
3...2....1...and oblivion. 
  
beep....................beep...................beep....................beep 
  
I woke up to a smiling nurse 
""It worked like a charm. Your pulse rate is a 59. You need to thank whatever God you believe in because you really pulled out of that one :)""
The next few days were spent getting an ultrasound of my heart, a MRI of my heart and some blood work. As it turned out, I dont have any major problems from it. The fact that I was able to procure 60 suboxone right before my heart issue ensured that I would be relatively well and not dopesick during my stay in ICU. Although, 24 mg of suboxone did nothing to alleviate my knee pain, runny nose, lack of sleep, and general malaise. Immodium is powerful stuff! 
  
I don't know if its my nature or what, but I always thought I was bulletproof. I never thought it would happen to me. I kept saying that I would stop using immodium eventually/ I would quit before some serious problem happened, but I got caught up. I was extremely arrogant. I have never been narcanned (through 13 years of addictive addiction) and I always have felt like I could beat anything. I think its my nature. 
  
One other thing- If youre asking yourself why I didnt go to the hospital the night where I couldnt feel my heart....IDK!! I felt like it would go away or something. I felt like If I got on suboxone the next day it would fix the problem. I was mandated to this rehab and felt like if I told them I was using something they would get me locked up again. This was very stupid on my part but its how I felt in this moment. If I had to do it over again, I wouldve gone to the ER. I am lucky to be alive and think if I wasnt in great shape at the time, I would have died. 
  
If you are megadosing immodium, stop right now and go to a methadone clinic or get on suboxone. 
  
If you are megadosing immodium and you are doing so because you're in sober living, tell your therapist whats going on and go back to detox. I think this is super common. People use immodium because it doesnt show up on piss tests.  I know in my case, I felt like I couldnt tell anyone because I would go back to jail. If I had to do it over again, I would tell someone before it EVER got to be that bad. 
  
I have a buddy, Justin, that died from this shit. He was sitting on the couch next to his wife and ended up passing away. He didn't get to the hospital before he died. 
There is somebody reading this post right now that is laughing saying ""diharrea pills HAHA!! who the fuck gets addicted to that shit!!""
There is another person reading this post that is helplessly strung out on this shit and doesn't know how to quit, knows the risks but doesn't think it will happen to them. Please get off this shit. It is only a matter of time before you end up in the hospital fighting for your life like me. 
I am a former IV heroin and fentanyl addict. I was addicted to OCs and Opanas. I have been there, done that. I was not some kid trying to get high off ""legal drugs"" because couldnt find real ones. And there was a time during this that immodium and its high became such a part of my life, I would choose it over heroin, because I could maintain a normal life on it as well as afford it. YES, you heard that correctly, There was a time when I loved immodium so much that I would have chosen it over other opioids. 
  
But at the end of the day this is an extremely dangerous substance, please....leave this shit alone. 
Edit: one other thing I forgot to add- I began failing for methadone at my rehab. It would pop on the cup, and then be confirmed negative at the lab. So, if you do it enough, you will pop for methadone. ",1/11/25 3:56,

Looking for feedback/advice on my detox plan. ,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hxyam2/looking_for_feedbackadvice_on_my_detox_plan/,"
SORRY THIS IS LONG I HAVE INCLUDED A SIGN XX SO YOU CAN SKIP SOME STUFF IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE READING THIS NOVEL OF A POST TO GET TO THE ACTUAL PLAN WITHOUT MY LIFE STORY
So I have tried and failed to get clean about 10 times the past year. I have been on and off mostly just dope for the past 6 years. In November my of 2018 my Mom and brother died in a car wreck. So I went from a “here and there” user to all the time. Recently since my last dope start date (Dec of 2023) the longest I made it was 5 days and that was because I flew out of town and was scarfing down kratom the whole time. Second best I ever got was 72 hours.
I wanted to get clean over Christmas break. But someone stole my script of Xanax and I didn't have any other comfort meds.
But now I do, so while I don't have 2 weeks I've got three days lol. But I've got IMO quite the nice stack of prescription comfort meds and supplements. So here is my plan. (well skip down to the two X's if you don't want all the extra dope boy back story BS)
Tried to tapper since Saturday, didn't go exactly as planned. Here's why: I do have 4 dope boys and one has that tranq dope, and he sells for $60 a g so I was going to him when I was poor. That was until I nodded out on a new job I finally got and got for after two weeks (well that wasn't the only reason but it was 80% of it. They legit thought it was an ""untreated sleep disorder"" because I don't ""look like a junkie"" and passed my initial drug test with fake pee. So I got my last good paycheck for them, bought one more ball and wallowed in my misery for 5 days or so and never went back. So I haven't hit him up since 11/12. Other dude wise; I have your typical cut and fent guy. One guy is hit or miss with either his shit being pretty weak or solid (REAL H not fent). Then there's my always shit dude. He has solid chunks of real dope in there (not fent) but this POS always cuts his shit by like 75%. I know it's shit to give this guy business. Because the hit or miss guy only cuts his shit bad when his supply gets low. But guy two is like I said hit or miss, you might get a great bag, you might get a bag that's 90% cut. And right now I am fixing to quit this HAS to be it. I am flying out of state for 2 weeks straight in 11 days from tomorrow and Kratom is illegal where I am going. So I went with the 75% cut dude since Sat. I used to rotate the 3 guys just whoever answered with the shit dope guy being my least favorite. But I have been using JUSt him on purpose since sat. I have been breaking down the chunks and mixing it. So why it's not exactly a tapper, I am not randomly getting good bags from hit or miss dude or getting fent from my fave dude. I tried to do a little less but it was too hard with my job. So idk if you can call that a tapper. Maybe cutting down? 
Whatever enough rambling. I started a new job 11/18 and this job is a manual labor job where I work 10 hour days 4 day t as(7:30-6pm) so I have 3 days off. 
XX (skip to hear if you didn't want to read all the extra BS)
Since I don't have two weeks and only have 3 days. I really did stack up on the comfort meds and supplements. 
OTC supplements I started Tuesday. Ester-C (not megadosing but am taking more than the bottle recommends, I am taking double the daily recommend dose) DLPA 2 caps in the morning 2 caps in the evening, Agmatine Sulfate (same regimen as DLPA) and BSO (have the liquid and gel caps. I am doing one gel tabs twice a day.
For the food (er well nutrition) during detox I bought 3 6-packs of Ensure, two regular ones and one high protein one. I also bought some liquid IV stuff to add to water and 4 Gatorades brand of the Pedialyte drinks. 
For prescription comfort meds I have two subs, Fifthteen 1mg kpins, two 2mg Xanbars, five 600mg gabapentin, 2 Adderall (don't know the amount)
The plan is to do my usual line before work and during lunch. And as soon as I get in my car to go home instead of a line, do a small final bump, just because it takes me 30 minutes to go home with no traffic, with it, it can sometimes take up to an hour, so I don't want to be sick in that. This bump WON'T get me high, hell it's so small I will probably only make me feel ""mostly well"" but I know my body and how it reacts to that amount.
So last small dose Thursday around 6 PM and no more. Gonna try to hold off on comfort meds as much as possible (only taking supplements 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
So last dose of dope around 6 PM Thurs. I was gonna take .75 of a sub Monday morning at 5:30 AM Monday. (then .5 Tues and Wed and then .25 Thurs. The goal was to rough it out the next weekend. And the addys were for work the following week (not whole things, small pieces because my energy will still be low) I will have my xanax script by then so if the anxiety and heart palpations should be addressed.
Sorry this is long, any input helps thanks!

I recently had a convulsive seizure in the middle of the street with no triggers, I had taken an oxy 20mg 2h, before, (while it was a period where I was taking 40 - 60 mg every day so I had some tolerance).
I know that oxy is stimulating and that you have to use it with caution if you have epilepsy, but I don't have epilepsy, I'm 20 years old and this kind of thing has never happened to me. And i NEVER ever heard that someone got an convulsive seizure due to oxy. Plus, I've taken many drugs in my life that were much more likely to trigger an epileptic seizure, such as stims or tramadol in large quantities.
That thing scares me a lil bit so if someone knows about all that i'd love an explanation cuz im scared that it could happen again at any moment.",1/9/25 21:38,

For me oxy feels like a stimulant without the negative effects of a stim like racing heart, anxiety, comedown etc. I feel like it's impossible to feel depressed while I'm high. Mix oxy with nicotine and coffee and I feel like a damn super human. 
Basically oxy doesn't feel like a downer to me at all. I've been at it for perhaps 5 months ish (with breaks) and it takes around 40-60 mg for me to get sufficiently high. Before I would get blasted from 20mg so I plan on taking a tolerance break soon. Anyone else relate?

To entering in rehab and start a treatment like methadone or suboxone they have to verify if you’re actually using those substances, so this morning I went to the clinic, I did an urine test (the fast one that shows in 5/10min the results) and I tested negative in all the opiates and opioids (heroin, morphine, codeine, buprenorphine, methadone, and other opioids/opiates substances, but oxy was not on the list for example), so they sent my sample to the laboratory to have a deeper analysis. My question is how is that even possible? I mean, I use oxy since a year every day (real OxyContin from pharmacy for those who are wondering) and my last dose was literally 12 hours before the test.
 (I always take oxy intranasal, but that shouldn’t be an issue since it always metabolize through your kidneys, or for example, substances like cocaine do results but their roa is intranasal.)
In 5 days, I’m going back again to do another test to make sure again, but do you guys know how chemically is possible that my test was negative? Is it because oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid and it has something to do with other substances which are not included in the test like I don’t know heroin?
What are your thoughts? In which category should the OxyCodone results positive? Morphine?

Threw almost four years clean down the drain.

At the end I ate three to four of those blue fuckers a day, it was terrible. I did the whole nine yards: got clean, moved cities, went to university, got a prestigious internship and finished my bachelors thesis with highest grades. All great, everybody so proud, but all along I was feeling like shit. I was young when I went to rehab, and I was in such a rush to get out in the world and prove everybody wrong that I didn't gave two fucks about what caused my addictive behaviour. 
Some months back, in June, I started taking benzodiazepines, I guess it was for anxiety symptoms. i never did it to get high, only in normal doses per se. Don't think I've ever taken over 40mg diazepam over 24 hrs. I made a deal with myself: hand in your bachelor thesis in December, then seek help. And that's what I did. I'm in the midst of a taper with my local addiction center, and on that front it's great something is being done. They might even offer me some therapy.
A few weeks back, although, life took unexpected turns. I was crushed, emotionally and financially. I bought an OC80, did 40mg, saved 40mg for the day after and nodded the fuck out for two days. The warm blanket felt exactly the way I remembered it. I know why I did it, but I regret it just as much as taking that first benzo back in June.
It was in the mid of December, today is January 8th, and I just did it for I think the tenth time or something like that. The 20mg don't get me nodding anymore, 40mg barely does. I can go two to three days, sensing no withdrawals, but then I do them again. As mentioned, this has been going on for some weeks.
I went to this sub for so much advice, support and comfort back in 2020 and 2021 when I was in active addiction and in my recovery phase. Now I'm on the steps of a nasty oxy habit again. Apparently, I can't get into my head what it is I'm doing. I did around 50mg tonight, and I plan of doing the rest. It will be the last pill, but I said that the last time and the last time again.
This may sound so fucking dumb, but please, someone, remind me why we don't do this shit. Remind me why this is the direct pathway to misery. Remind that I'm better than this. Remind me there's still a turning point without going through the whole nine yards again. I'm not sure I can do that.",1/8/25 21:02,

Do cravings EVER go away?,9,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hw6m5m/do_cravings_ever_go_away/,"I've used all kinds of opiates/oids for a looong time now stemming from getting annihilated in an accident. After managing to find a doctor who actually takes care of his pain patients I was able to get off the street bullshit and back onto oxycodone, but the thing is even now, YEARS after putting the foil down and associating it with way more bad times than good ones, I'll still randomly get these completely feral cravings to go smoke a bag. They come on really hard and fast and leave after maybe 10-30 mins but they're so intense I worry I might actually cave and end up doing it again one day.
I originally started using heroin when pain management decided to torture me with undertreatment, then progressed to fent, then whatever I could get my hands on ranging from mystery fentalogues to O-DSMT to U-47700 and stuff as the supply changed. Before this happened I never had any actual opioid cravings. I only ""craved"" my pain meds because they took my pain away, but it was never to get high. I was in so much agony for so long that I didn't need to get high because not being in blinding fucking pain 24/7/365 was a high in and of itself, I never *wanted* anything more than that. But it feels like ever since I first used heroin and caught a nod I experienced a piece of heaven that my brain associates with copping a bag and smoking it and is just going to claw after this action until the day I die. Just wondering what other people's experiences have been like. Pain mismanagement not only stole years and years of my life from me as a teenager and 20 something and nearly killed me, but I also worry that forcing me onto the street has just permanently imprinted on me and these fent fits will never go away.",1/8/25 0:26,

When I go to pick up my box from the injecting rooms I always have to point out which ones on the shelf they are & then continue to tell me im one of the very few people to use them.
Most people stick to BD or Trumeo, both of which I find utterly useless, extremely blunt and lead to me turning my self into a human pin cushion. Also the multigates have this handy feature where as when you pull on the device to suck the water up the plunger won't simply slide out out the top it requires a good tug to get the plunger out. Caus its always a bitch when your doing your hit up and in haste you pull the whole damn plunger out while trying to get those drugs inside it loll.
Im in Australia so the brands may differ in your part of the world although im sure they are all made in china.
So fellow IV opiate users what is your go to brand, do you have a reason as to why? I've noticed most people just stick to whatever the old vending machines would spit out back in the day.... but now we live in the future of syringe choices! Exciting times to be alive lol.

We need to legalize opium,272,191,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hvaxqv/we_need_to_legalize_opium/,"For centuries, opium was openly used to treat life-threatening conditions like dysentery—no Narcan, no modern medicines, and yet no societal collapse. In fact, this access to a potent, natural remedy helped countless people survive severe illness and increased overall life expectancy. Now, despite all our medical advancements and overdose-reversal drugs, we’re witnessing unprecedented opioid-related deaths—directly tied to strict criminalization that drives opium (and stronger synthetic opioids) underground. Legalizing opium simply acknowledges a proven historical reality: societies prospered, lives were saved, and harm remained low when opium wasn’t demonized or forced into illicit channels. If we truly care about preventing overdoses, keeping patients safe, and preserving personal freedom, the straightforward answer is to stop criminalizing a natural medicine that has served humanity for millennia.

my wife and i have been occasional H users for the past couple of years. two nights ago around 3am, my wife was breathing loudly and strangely and moving around a lot, which thankfully woke me up. she was conscious but extremely disoriented, cross eyed, and said she felt like she was dying. i was half awake and very confused because as far as i knew, we had gone to bed at the same time (around three hours prior) and therefore she wouldn’t have taken anything recently because we were asleep. i gave her narcan and she very quickly went back to normal, color came back into her lips, breathing normally and everything. she fell back asleep and i stayed up to monitor her. in the morning she didn’t remember anything. she had no memory of taking anything during the night. a few months ago she started sleepwalking randomly for the first time in her life, and we haven’t been able to figure out what is causing it. currently the theory for the other night is that she managed to take the H while sleepwalking (she has managed to roll and smoke cigarettes while fully asleep so i wouldn’t be surprised) and obviously didn’t know what she was doing because she was asleep, and took too much. so now i have to hide it from her when she goes to sleep. it’s the first time we’ve ever had any kind of close call like that and it’s really been stressful for me, i can’t stop ruminating about it. it doesn’t help that i can’t talk about it with people irl since no one really knows that we are users. if i hadn’t woken up i don’t know what would have happened.

Accidently used cocaine instead of Dope.,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hukli4/accidently_used_cocaine_instead_of_dope/,"I accidentally injected cocaine instead of heroin. I had just bought 6 bags total—5 bundled together and 1 loose bag. Since I often receive it like this, I didn’t think twice.
My usual method is IV injection, so I prepped my dose by combining the loose bag with 3 from the bundle, cooked it, and filtered it into a syringe. I hit a vein on the first try, which was rare for me. Expecting the familiar rush, I knew something was wrong within seconds—a loud ringing filled my head, and a powerful surge swept from my toes to my head. That’s when it hit me: This was cocaine.
I hadn’t used cocaine since 2015, and even then, only snorted it a few times. But I recognized the feeling immediately. Panic set in as I realized I had just IV’d 4 bags with no tolerance. I was shaking uncontrollably, fumbling to call my dealer, who I’ve known since 2016. When she finally answered, I whispered, 'You gave me coke, not heroin! Did you know?' She was extremely apologetic and reassured me that only the loose bag was cocaine, not the entire batch. And she had accidently mixed 1 bag with the 5 of mine when putting it together.
Relief washed over me. I genuinely thought I was going into cardiac arrest. I was even praying, thinking it might be the end for me. This experience taught me a hard lesson: Always test your supply. Complacency can be deadly. If the whole batch had been cocaine, I might not be here to tell this story.

Thought I’d give this a try it was cheap from outside the US and said what the hell. I hear people saying euphoria akin to oxys. 
My experience so far is you get a tiny window of euphoria then I just feel weird.  And it makes me just want to nod and I hallucinate in a way. I loved oxys because they gave me a boost of energy. These are opposite plus it kinds fucks with your balance. 
I’ve tried 100mg dose, 200, and 400. I can function with 100 but it doesn’t give much recreational value.

How was the downfall into addiction like for you guys,14,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1huftbe/how_was_the_downfall_into_addiction_like_for_you/,"OK, so I’m going to start this out by saying I don’t plan on doing opioids ever again(I’ve only done codeine a few times early last year) and I am asking more for a friend
I am trying to convince a friend not to do oxy(for a variety of reasons like it ruining lives and tolerance = harder time for when you ACTUALLY need it), he told me that it’s gonna be a once and done deal but I have a hard time believing that since he previously had problem with other less problematic substances
So I got some questions for you guys(specifically ones who are in active addiction or recovery, and started recreationally):
1. When before you first took oxy/any opioids, did you view it as a once and done deal or were you like viewing it as something something you’ll do once a month or did you view it as something you did regularly
2. How was your relationship with other substances(like were you able to control yourself with other substances you used)
3. If you were having problems with other substances before hand, how does it compare to opioid addiction
4. What made opioids special to you
5. Do you regret ever touching opioids
6. Did opioid addiction affect you in various ways, like financially or socially
These are the questions I can currently think of, but you can go more in depth on your descent into opioid addiction 
I genuinely just don’t want my friend going into opioids, and I’m trying to convince him to just dispose of your oxys and not to even touch them
Can any of you give me some insight on your guy’s experiences 
(I think opioids can be amazing if used in the right scenario, specifically pain when it is prescribed properly, one of my concerns would be if he gets into it recreationally, tolerance will fuck him up medically)
My friend says that he hasn’t disposed of it because he’s trying to practice self discipline, but I don’t know what will happen when he finally takes the pill, and I don’t think it’ll be good

I'm sure it lowers my inhibitions a little but not as much as like benzos or alcohol. I usually don't say these things to others though for obvious reasons.

I know this is kind of weird I promise I'm not severely mentally ill it's just on opioids lol especially ones that give you a nice energy boost.

I’m writing something and am trying to describe dope sickness to someone who’s never experienced it,56,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1htxiuf/im_writing_something_and_am_trying_to_describe/,"Would love some feedback…did I forget anything?
Lots of people compare it to the worst flu you’ve ever had—I disagree. It’s not just being sick; it’s like your body is betraying you, turning every moment into an excruciating eternity. For most—including myself—it starts with uncontrollable yawning, the biggest yawns you’ve ever had, coming relentlessly every few seconds. Your eyes water until tears stream down your face, and your jaw starts to ache from the constant stretching. But these aren’t normal yawns—they’re the first sign that something is seriously wrong, like your body is trying to expel something it can’t reach.
Then comes this creeping anxiety that won’t go away. It claws at your mind and makes your heart race as if you’re being chased—but you know you can’t run because the horror is coming from inside you. The panic is paired with a deep, gnawing dread, like every bit of hope has been drained from your soul.
Next, there’s the sweating. Hot one minute, freezing the next. You’ll be drenched and shivering at the same time, your skin crawling with an unbearable sensation, like bugs burrowing beneath it. You can’t get comfortable—ever. Your legs, arms, everything aches, throbs, or twitches uncontrollably. Even lying still feels like torture because your muscles won’t stop screaming for relief.
You’d think you might get relief when you go to sleep, right? Wrong. You’ll toss and turn all night, wide awake, trying every possible position to find one that’s comfortable. It doesn’t matter how cozy you try to make it—you’ll feel every fiber of every blanket and sheet against your skin. It’s either too soft and tickles, too itchy, or too rough. It’s too hot with blankets and too cold without them. You’ll want to be naked, but if your clammy skin rubs against itself, it’ll send shivers throughout your body. Occasionally, you might pass out for a few minutes, but it’s not real rest—it’s more like your brain glitches out from exhaustion before waking you up in a panic, like the feeling you get when you wake up hours late for work.
You won’t be able to eat or drink either, thanks to the constant nausea and cramps. If you do manage to choke anything down, it’ll likely come right back up or go straight through you. It’s like your guts are in open rebellion. Between not being able to keep anything down, the diarrhea, and the constant need to pee, you become dangerously dehydrated and malnourished. Pair that with lack of sleep, and you turn into a complete zombie, stuck in a nightmarish state of delirium.
All your senses become so intense it feels like your brain might short-circuit. The lights are too bright, everything smells and tastes too strong, every touch is painful, and every sound is too loud. Your emotions become completely out of control and unmanageable. You’ll cry out of nowhere—sobbing, snot running down your face—feeling like the most pathetic creature alive. Every regret, every mistake, every ounce of shame you’ve ever felt comes rushing in, drowning you in guilt.
 And then there’s the need—this overwhelming, all-consuming urge that screams in your mind. It insists that one small action will end the nightmare. You don’t just think about it—you feel it in every fiber of your being, like survival itself depends on it. The worst part? You know that giving in only resets the cycle, but enduring another endless minute, hour, or day feels equally impossible.
Once you’re more than a day into it you can’t even do anything to try and fix it. the only way you’ll get relief is if someone helps you. You can’t hustle at that point. I’ve been so sick and seen people so sick that can’t even talk let alone walk. Even if you do get more dope somehow you are so shaky, you can barely even do it without assistance. When you’re in such absolute rough shape, reduced to just a leaky, disgusting delirious shell of a person,  very few people will want to have anything to do with you let alone help you. It is nothing if not humbling.",1/5/25 4:26,

Got recommended DXM for chronic pain?,1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1htp02x/got_recommended_dxm_for_chronic_pain/,"Hey, I'm sorry for posting this but the information on the matter is so scattered i don't know what to make of it. So i have many issues i won't bore you with but aside from the herniated discs and Fibroymalgia, my Myofascial Pain Syndrome is by far the most frustrating. I can't live a normal life. 
Anyway. Been 15+ years of Pregabalin and Oxycodone but I barely exist at this point. A friend realized my depression due to the pain taking my energy and he recommended looking into DXM. What I've gathered though mixed seems to be:
- Serotonin Syndrome - definitely possible when combined with many SSRI and antidepressants. 
- Pain Relief - this seems to be a given? Even where people disagree, it seems it is simply a dosage issue. 
- Depression Relief- trying to do this without Google so I forget the name, forgive me. It is combined with something and given for depression. As an actual Rx.
- Opiate Potentiation - this is what is mixed and thus my question. 
So I need more pain relief than I receive but my doctor is by the book. The US has a ridiculous 90MME equivalent (mg of Morphine) so 60MG of Oxycodone. 
How do I safely incorporate this into my pain relief regimen? Should I take them at the same time? And as a general question, what MG would make sense for my specific situation? The antidepressants being prescribed i believe were 45mg but I am looking for pain relief. Thanks for reading guys",1/4/25 21:32,
was i oding on 40mg oxy ?,1,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1htox6r/was_i_oding_on_40mg_oxy/,"so recently i started getting into oxy. i know, i know not the best decision. i started off by trying two rp 10s which i didnt feel. i thought maybe i just have a naturally higher tolerance to opioids, even mixed in a little kratom to try and boost any effects. about two weeks later, (last night) i received an order, i got some mundiphara oc 80s. i wasn’t planning on taking damn 40mg of if but i split it in half, than split it again so i had 4 20mg peices. i took 20mg orally, and waited about 30/45 minutes. i didn’t feel any very noticeable effects so i decided to crush up the other 20mg half and snort untill i felt desired effect. long story short i snorted the whole other 20mg so i was a total of 40mg deep. i’m not quite sure how to explain the feeling, i felt a little euphoric and very droswy. i was so tired i could barely keep my eyes open. eventually i got really nauseous and it was a little harder to breath, ended up chugging water and throwing it all up which made me feel a bit better but my breath still felt very shallow which made my anxiety turn up a bit. i tried to stay up as long as i possibly could because i was paranoid and didn’t wanna have to have someone take me to the er, i read oxy ods arnt necessarily fast and sometimes take 1-3 hours so i was getting a bit paranoid. i eventually fell asleep and woke back up. i honestly dont think this was an overdose, definitely a bit too much, but i wanna hear some other peoples opinions. should i just completely stop even trying with oxy? or should i just find a better dose ?",1/4/25 21:28,

10 years ago... anyone still here from back then?,71,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1htkoc0/10_years_ago_anyone_still_here_from_back_then/,"I try to come here once a year to share my brother's story. It's cathartic for me, and I sincerely hope helpful for anyone struggling and wanting to get clean. 
10 years ago I was visiting my family in NJ. We were going to spend the holidays with my family. It was lovely. My brother seemed to be doing great. He was playing with my kids and laughing and having such a great time.  He had supposedly been clean for a few months at this point. On Wednesday he told us he wanted to really make a change, because even though he wasn't using he felt stuck. He said he wanted to come to church with my family that upcoming Sunday. And maybe he would finally take me up on my offer for him to come live with us for a while. There was a really toxic situation between him and our dad. 
On Friday we were all going to go this dinosaur event with animatronic dinosaurs or whatever. For the kids. But that morning he said he was going to meet up with someone to play disc golf instead. We all went to the dinosaur thing. Came home, normal day, but never heard from my brother. As the night got later my mom was freaking out. I really didn't believe the worst could have happened. Even when my brother was using he told me he was a ""smart user"" and not like those ""other dumbasses"". I've never used opiates before, so words like ""test shot"" and whatever he did to ensure his safety went over my head.  I assumed maybe he met some girl and was staying with her. 
Then the next day came and went, with no word or sign from him. At this point my parents had tried to file a police report, but a 28 year old missing man wasn't high on anyone's priority list aside from ours. 
He had a tablet at the time, and I decided to look at his history. He was on Reddit all the time. Specifically this sub every single day. At this time I had never heard of Reddit. I created an account (username makes sense now?) and posted here, probably breaking all sorts of rules but the mods were really nice and let it slide. Many, many redditors reached out with great advice, and some even volunteered to call hospitals and police stations for me. (Unfortunately I was not tech savvy at the time, and I didn't know how to see what my brother's username was. I wish I did, though I think he was definitely more of a lurker than a poster.)
Another day and sleepless night passed and I started to agree with my mom, something bad must have happened.  We looked at his EZ Pass charges and saw the last charge was in Newark on Friday. We drove all around Newark, but didn't see him or his car anywhere. All the calls redditors were making for me weren't turning up any leads either. We went home, still trying to convince ourselves that maybe he took off with some ex-gf or something. But when we got home, just a few minutes later, two detectives from Newark NJ came knocking on the door.
They told us that they found a body they suspected was my brother. They told us he was dead, probably for a few days based on the condition of his body. They thought he was a homeless John Doe, because instead of helping him, someone stole his wallet. Since I was visiting from out of town my brother let me use his bedroom, and he put a lot of his stuff in his car, creating this situation that made it appear like he had been living out of his car for some time. Really he was staying with family, but was keeping clothes and personal things in his car.
I'm assuming he was robbed after he died because his car looked trashed, his wallet was missing along with expensive hockey gear, and dog grooming tools. I'd like to get angry at whoever decided to rob his dead body instead of trying to get help, but really I can't imagine living a life where you're so desensitized to seeing a body like that you don't think twice about taking whatever's valuable.
My brother was a single, 28 year old man. I don't think he felt like he had any really close friends, was estranged from our dad, and I imagine that he never dreamed his death would matter much anyway. He couldn't have been more wrong. It's been 10 years and we are still devastated. The entire family that used to be so close has completely shattered. I'm the oldest, and our baby sister is just a shell of herself. Our brother was her person, and losing him sent her into a spiral, I'm not sure she'll ever find her way out. My mom doesn't speak to her sisters, and all the cousins that were once like siblings are splintered.
  
The truth is, I thought this would get easier with time. But siblings are supposed to be there to age with you. I turned 40 last year. My brother should be 38, and we should be talking about our aging parents together. He should be the fun amazing uncle to my kids. He should have his own family that he wanted. He would have been such a good dad. Please, if you think no one would care if you died, think again. The ripple effect is unreal.
  
I'm sorry this is getting so long. I just wanted to share one more part of the story. My brother's best friend from high school came to our house as soon as he found out. I don't remember the last time they saw each other, but he just walked in the front door, hugged my mom and they both sobbed uncontrollably. Then he went into my brother's room and trashed it, while screaming, ""YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!!"" I went in and he looked like a wild animal. He finally sat on the bed and cried, and told me how much they had talked about this. How my brother had promised him he was done with this shit, and he would call if he ever felt like using again. 10 years later this friend is now carrying out a sentence in mental hospital. There were a lot of factors, but I do think losing my brother really broke him too. 
Was my brother trying to use  one last time before he came to church with us and really committed to changing his whole life? Or were we all fooled, and he really was never clean? Had he been clean long enough his tolerance was lower? Was there fent he didn't know about in whatever he shot up? We'll never know. But I do know this, there's no safe way to use heroin. Please, please don't convince yourself you're smarter than the next guy. My brother never stole from anyone, never went to rehab, and never OD'd before. He had been using heroin for about a year before he died. This drug doesn't let you get to rock bottom. 
Thanks for letting me share. I don't think I'll continue the yearly posts, 10 years seems like a good time to end this tradition. ",1/4/25 18:23,
Opiates make me feel normal again ,36,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1htj3rs/opiates_make_me_feel_normal_again/,"I know this is going to come across controversial and I’m in no way saying it’s safe, or a sustainable thing to do, but I have exhausted nearly everything my psychiatrist could try on me at this point. 
I’ve suffered with severe treatment resistant major depressive disorder, anhedonia, social anxiety and C-PTSD / ADHD for a while now which has just gotten worse with age, and with the loss of my father 6 years ago sent me over the edge. 
I have so far tried 16+ different prescription medications, TMS, Ketamine, Therapy, reward reprocessing, TDCS, exercise, diet and many lifestyle / environmental changes. Nothing has worked. 
I have lived in a permanent state of “never feeling rewarded for what I do” for as long as I can remember, apathetic and nihilistic. I could sit in bed all day, but be bored at the same time, and extremely depressed and overthink, take something to slow my thinking down; it ends up making my thoughts so down, but I’m even MORE depressed from being zombified, it’s an utter nightmare. when I am busy, I’m completely apathetic and anhedonic, the reward isn’t there, and my social anxiety makes it near impossible to function. Stepping out my door I’m in a sweat, no medication has helped this, or if it does, it causes such awful worsening of my Anhedonia that there’s 0 benefit. 
Opiates unfortunately are the ONLY substance, both illicit and prescribed, that has consistently brought me relief. - Kratom, oxycodone and the big one, Poppy seed tea. 
I was sober from using poppy seed tea for 6 months daily, eventually having to go in subs to get off it in three months, and was sober for 16+ months but those 16+ months, nothing changed, I was exactly how I was and it just reminded me why I started it in the first place. 
I’m using again, but with naltrexone, trying my best to keep damage as low as possible, because without it, simply I CANNOT function anymore. I can’t. Therapy, meds, exercise all that blah blah blah, it doesn’t work for me. 
I have spent hours upon hours in 2024 researching every night until 6am neuroscience trying to fix myself, with the help of my psychiatrist, he is puzzled as I am. 
I just want to vent as I’m feeling quite alone on this. Has anybody else found that with similar mental health difficulties, even though you’ve genuinely tried extremely hard to find a way without opiates, you don’t find relief and eventually steer back towards them? I don’t want to take an amount to get high, feeling my normal, childhood like self how I used to when I was young is euphoric in itself. I’m exhausted. 
Edit: I am on amphetamine adhd stimulants which help “get me up”, but the “reward” for doing simple tasks, even eating; isn’t there; along with the chronic, persistent social anxiety make thing impossible. Again, I’ve tried all kinds of therapy for my CPTSD to no avail. I started to feel this pre ANY substance use. ",1/4/25 17:14,
How does methadone fit in?,3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hth0lu/how_does_methadone_fit_in/,"So my local drug service has started me on low dose methadone at 30mg but upping me to 40mg next week. The adjustment to methadone from h wasn’t fun at all and I found myself still wanting to score but social pressure more from my family was the only thing preventing it. I guess I’m kinda stable at the moment but a lot of the day I find myself wanting to score. 
I was addicted to crack for about 5 years and opiates were more of a background thing but once I stopped smoking crack I replaced it with h and oxycodone. Before long I was combining crack and h in the same pipe but ultimately became unsustainable financially. 
How does methadone work for other people? Is it for easing financial stress? Easing cravings? Kicking the withdrawal further down the road? 
I guess I’m seeking advice as to whether methadone is good in the long run. It’s been kinda settling to be level for a change which is a bonus. Is this its purpose? 
I’m told at my meetings that once they find the right dose for me things will get better. Any experience that you can share would be great ",1/4/25 15:41,

A couple of months ago my guy who’s been consistent for 8-10 years gave me some crazy fent/xylazine mix that almost took me out( I stopped being careful when the product never really changed)but i thought i was  sick truly ill, i was doing smaller amounts of this stuff (before I tested) and my Bp was low heart pounding from the smallest movement i couldnt get up to get water or move in general which is already limited from my disability .. fast forward a couple months later different source, every batch is different i can get 2g and call back and its different i found out its a bunch of batches mixed and the mixing is done by call for grams so its never the same.
I was fine for a bit honestly i was scared to do any amount that wasn’t a dot even thought im a bull i can eat Dope so i was sick on and off for a bit finally I relinquished and did the right amount for me to get well and was okay then i got new stuff that made my heart pound but didnt make me feel like i was gonna pass out and keel from a popped heart, now i get supposedly the same thing and something else thats new and im well longer then the last ones “ i lasted from 11-5 which is absolutely insane it was every 2-3 hrs on the dot but now i cant function i get progressively worse as the night progresses (ive also been taking alot of gabapentin for my shot nerve’s but originally i wasn’t on much- pain has gotten worse) in also pretty much non mobile i dont have to drive to cop i dont see people my pain has gotten to the point where the little things i did cant be done, my good friend says its atrophy I have not been  mobile for years.
I had multiple operations that were deemed done improperly and was mobile on 400mg OC for years but then the rods broke screw’s fractured and i figure life’s easier if i tranquilize myself and sleep as long as i can and its a plus that i dont have to do as much dope, so maybe it’s that ? but last week i was able to piss without the room spinning my heart pounding and feeling numb. 
I’m wondering if anyone has had problems like this with fent or RCs xylazine etc or is my body just truly giving out .

Do you think addicts are a cursed people?,26,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ht2sxx/do_you_think_addicts_are_a_cursed_people/,"Not literally cursed, as if some ancient Egyptian God is continually spiting addicts throughout the millennia, but metaphorically so.
Whenever I think about my own life and the feelings and circumstances that brought me to opioid addiction, I can’t help but feel like it’s so objectively tragic.
I can only speak for myself, but I have to imagine many of you will relate to these feelings. 
Personally, I used opioids as a way to escape myself. I hated who I was, what I felt, and what I thought about *so deeply* that it caused me to seek out the one class of drugs that everyone and their mother says will kill you. I would rather risk death and destitution, on every hour of every day, rather than learn to live with myself. 
I despised what it felt like to live in my own skin. I hated waking up every day and having to deal with myself. I was in so much pain that I resorted to taking a drug that I knew would kill me and ruin my life eventually, and I simply didn’t care. 
And this is what brings me back to the subject of addicts being “cursed.”
Not to throw a pity party for myself or addicts writ large, but to me, this behavior reads like the saddest form of self destruction humans can exhibit. 
It’s a deep, penetrating self-hatred that we try and fail to salve with the most destructive form of self-medication - leading us to hate ourselves even more once the drugs compound all the issues that drove us to addiction in the first place. And finally, watching helplessly as the drugs slowly turn us into unrecognizable shadows of our former selves. 
There are an endless amount of horrific afflictions that people can get slapped with, but if you ask me, addiction is one of the most tragic and insidious of them all.
I would do anything to be able to live with and love myself without the drugs, but I simply don’t believe it’s possible. I’m so tired of myself.

He has a full finished basement and no job as we pay all the bills and buy all the food. She refuses to give him and ultimatum and chooses to believe every word he says. This time apparently his girlfriend who I guess lives her now came back to find him already overdosed. I believe she brought the drugs.. She is an addict too but now being treated like a hero. They used the 2 narcan doses we had here plus whatever EMS administered. I was at work this time. She didn't tell me my neighbor did. I even asked her what the flashing lights were around the house for as they were on a camera. She moved the outside ones even. Lied right to my face saying she had no idea. Had him and his girlfriend stay on our main floor that night where they proceeded to use. Hell he was all bent over sitting in the recliner at 3am and she just sat him up. I have to side the aluminum foil in my room and now probably my work boots. She has no job and has decided she can not have a debit card as he always talks her into buying him something he will eventually return for money. Its getting to be a bit much for me. Our relationship has been all but destroyed but I've been here 20 years almost I don't want to walk away. I love her she is my life. I am watching this destroy her. Her health has declined a considerable amount the last 5 years due to stress. I tried offering the best in the states help and after care to her first to present to him. She flipped out screaming at me telling me I always hated him. Which is FAR from the truth. I hate who he has become. Stealing from him 9 year old niece, grandparents, or really anyone. My basement is destroyed. His health i can only imagine.

I feel like it should be straightforward, but I ask because I have seen it said that it's impossible to get high on methadone if you're stable on a script, and if that IS the case im interested to know why - it is a full opiate agonist like any other is it not?

Opioid side effect (eye pressure/pain) advice?,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hru5an/opioid_side_effect_eye_pressurepain_advice/,"To be clear I am not seeking medical advice.
I am in pain management.
So I have tried several medications (lyrica + tramadol, lyrica + vicodin, lyrica + oxycodone)for chronic pain and I am having the same side effect with different opioids for some reason. I wasn't sure if other people do and my doctors have been trying different opioids to try to figure out why it is causing it...
They know its specifically not the lyrica because I don't have the side effect when on lyrica alone. I do have side effect if I take opioid alone and with lyrica. But I need to take the lyrica with opioid to properly manage the pain.
So I get what feels like increase pressure behind my left eye and intense pain what feels like behind my left eye/temple region in head. Which sucks because I am perscribed the opioids for chronic pain while recovery from complete ""frayed"" bicep that has to be reattached and bone/muscle removal from my shoulder/rotator cuff.
I should add I have been to ophthalmologist and optometrist who checked my eye pressure and said it's normal despite me ""feeling"" pressure type pain.
So on one hand trying to use the opioids to manage the pain while I heal from multiple surgeries, but it's also causing a very specific pain (what feels like pressure) pain in left temple and eye region.
So was just asking if this was something to be expected (my doctors say this is odd reaction) so I'm reaching out and seeing what I can possibly maybe do to help alleviate this pressure pain, while still taking opioids until I heal completely so I don't have to manage pain anymore.

Withdrawal symptoms after one day of use - past history of kratom,3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hrp9jd/withdrawal_symptoms_after_one_day_of_use_past/,"So I’ve never used dihydrocodeine before. Last night I took around 400ng staggered into two doses.

Mentally i felt anxious.
Is this possible to have a sort of rebound effect so quickly after th drug wears off?
I have loads more of the stuff but as much as I loved it, I’m not touching it again for a while given how horrible I felt this morning.
The only other thing I’d note is that I used to be addicted to Kratom a year ago. I quite cold. Turkey from 20gpd. I had the same bone aches for 3 days.

I’ve been addicted too opiates for 3 years now mainly oxymorphone ,morphine and diladud.
I have tried everything too get off these opioids such as
1.benzos
2.suboxone
3.cold turkey 
Nothing works  
Until I found SR-17018 it’s not a perfect substance like people on here make it out too be but it takes away 75 percent of withdrawal and decreases your tolerance at the same time
Dosing every 7-12 hours 
Low tolerance 25-50mg
Fent zone tolerance 100-150mg 
Effects 
No euphoria or high per se your almost sober but takes away dope sickness maybe a little sedation . But rapidly decreases opioid tolerance 
Day 1
Wake up 6:30am in agony cold sweats and intense pain but still have too go too work  so I dose the SR-17018 at 30mg . 2 hours later I can actully enjoy myself a little bit for the first time in years 0 euphoria tho . 
5:00pm I get off take half a Xanax bar and start railing lines of ketamine I truly felt like I was normal again 
Day 2 I have too work again wake up at 7:00am 
Every morning I wake up I’m in  intense pain due too not dosing so it takes me a while too get going at 2:00pm I slipped up and took some diladud so I have too restart the next day 
Day 3 (restart)
Wake up at 7 dose some SR-17018 then head to work . All my coworkers say I seem like a different person even my family . I can actully socialize properly and I’m not dying on the inside 
Day 4 today Im off today and I’m contmept on detoxing on opioids too get my life back !!!  ",12/31/24 19:15,

I was able to get about 24 hours in cold turkey when I finally couldn’t take it anymore. I broke down and took a quarter tab of of 7oh. That made me just comfortable enough to finally sleep. 
Since then I have taken a quarter tab about every 6-8 hours (I am not getting any high from this, just trying to be comfortable enough to tolerate the physical symptoms). It’s worked okay but I am about to come up on 72 hrs clean.
So several questions. First is when do you guys think I should stop the quarter tab of 7oh and finally step off for good? From what I’ve read, physical wd is at its worse at day 3 and gradually gets better from there.
What was your experience finally stopping oxy? How long did it take you to actually start feeling like yourself again? 
I’ve been taking oxy pretty steadily throughout this whole year up until last months script only lasted like 2 weeks, which is the first time something like that has happened to me while having an oxy script. This month I ran out in a week and still have like 3 weeks until my next refill. At this point I could see the writing on the wall and where this was leading.

Help!! Saline solution mixed with H for easy use relief sinus dryness. ,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hq6gvz/help_saline_solution_mixed_with_h_for_easy_use/,"As the title suggests, I’ve been dissolving my substance (diacetylmorphine) in distilled water for a while and using it intranasally. However, I’ve started noticing significant dryness and irritation.
Today, I decided to try mixing it with a saline solution I bought on Amazon. The bottle labeled it as a “nasal moisturizer,” claiming it was safe for daily use. I assumed it would be harmless.
However, when I mixed a significant amount of the substance with the saline solution, I noticed a distinct smell. Upon checking the ingredient list, I realized it contained more than just distilled water and sodium chloride (saline). It also included disodium phosphate, phenylcarbinol, monosodium phosphate, and benzalkonium chloride. As I stirred the mixture, I noticed precipitates forming and gas being released, which suggests a chemical reaction has occurred.
This raises my main concerns:
	1.	Has the diacetylmorphine undergone a chemical transformation due to these ingredients?
	2.	Is the solution still safe for use?
	3.	Have I effectively wasted a gram of the substance?
From what I’ve researched, the ideal solution for this purpose seems to be pure distilled water or saline made from sodium chloride pellets. I plan to switch to that moving forward. However, in the meantime, can I safely use this mixture? Any knowledgeable insights would be greatly appreciated.

Preventing Necrosis from Xylazine,10,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hpvfi9/preventing_necrosis_from_xylazine/,"To first try to figure out how to reduce necrosis caused by Xylazine we have to look at Xylazine's Pharmacological Effects:
* **Alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonist**: Xylazine works by stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which decreases sympathetic nervous system activity. This results in:
   * **Vasoconstriction** (narrowing of blood vessels): Reduced blood flow can deprive tissues of oxygen and nutrients, leading to ischemia and tissue damage.
* **Sedation and Reduced Mobility**: Prolonged immobility from xylazine’s sedative effects can impair blood circulation in the extremities, exacerbating poor tissue oxygenation.
Just throwing this out there because I thought it was interesting. While I was still using I was trying various different methods to prevent necrosis while injecting fetty with Xylazine. What I found to work best was actually Viagra (no this is not a joke), here's why...
In theory, Viagra (sildenafil) could have some potential to help mitigate tissue damage like necrosis, especially in its early stages, due to its mechanism of action. Viagra is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor that enhances nitric oxide signaling, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and increased blood flow. This improved blood circulation could theoretically help deliver more oxygen and nutrients to damaged tissues, which are critical for wound healing and preventing further tissue death.
But with that said we have to look at Sildenafil (Viagra)'s mechanism vs practicality:
* While Viagra improves blood flow, necrosis caused by xylazine or other factors often involves complex mechanisms, including severe localized inflammation, infection, and direct tissue damage.
* Improved circulation alone might not be enough to counteract these factors fully.
There's also risks from side effects:
* Viagra can lower blood pressure, which might be risky for individuals with unstable cardiovascular health or those using other medications or substances that affect blood pressure. But most notably,  Xylazine is an analog of Clonidine, which means that Xylazine already lowers your blood pressure significantly.
There are also some other honorable mentions that I considered but have not tried:
**L-arginine**, an amino acid that boosts nitric oxide production, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and improved blood circulation. This mechanism is similar to how medications like Viagra function. Some evidence suggests that high doses of L-arginine can enhance blood flow, which may aid in tissue oxygenation and healing. However, side effects can include nausea, cramps, and diarrhea. It's also important to note that L-arginine should not be taken with sildenafil (Viagra).
Another supplement to consider is **Ginkgo biloba**, an herbal remedy known to improve blood circulation by promoting vasodilation. This increased blood flow can enhance oxygen delivery to tissues, potentially supporting wound healing. However, Ginkgo biloba may cause side effects such as headaches, dizziness, and gastrointestinal upset. Additionally, it can interfere with blood clotting, so it should be used cautiously, especially in individuals taking blood thinners or those with bleeding disorders.
Some other considerations...
*""Topical antibiotics are commonly used in combination with petrolatum-based ointments to decrease bacterial burden of xylazine-associated wounds and promote autolytic debridement.""*
*""1% silver sulfadiazine (e.g., Silvadene™) has been a preferred topical therapy in caring for individuals with xylazine-associated wounds. Silver sulfadiazine is a prescription topical antibiotic that is often used in the treatment of burn wounds in outpatient and inpatient settings. It has broad spectrum antimicrobial effects and a low chance of generating antibiotic resistance. 42,43 The antimicrobial effect of silver sulfadiazine stays active for over 72 hours after application, which provides ongoing treatment for patients who have less access to dressing changes.43 In addition, silver sulfadiazine maintains moisture that can promote autolytic debridement and reduce tissue trauma during dressing changes.""*

* Ointments containing **platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)** or **epidermal growth factor (EGF)** may stimulate cell regeneration and vascularization, aiding in tissue repair.
* An antimicrobial cream that maintains wound moisture and may reduce bacterial colonization in necrotic areas.

Anywho, just wanted to throw some ideas out there for anyone who is struggling with this. I'm not a doctor by any means, was just looking for harm reduction ideas and this is all that I came up with. Viagra did actually help a bit initially. I could tell because the first thing that happens after prolonged Xylazine IV use is your blood starts to turn really dark and almost black. And after dosing Viagra with Xylazine my blood began to return to its normal color while injecting.",12/30/24 19:36,

suboxone making me feel weird - depression and my treatment.,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hpub95/suboxone_making_me_feel_weird_depression_and_my/,"back story - located in canada, at 14 I was prescribed trammadol and then percocet for 3 herniated discs, I was abruptly taken aff of them after a year, I then started getting hydros off of a family member, I had a conversation with the doc that was prescribing pain meds and he turned me to a methadone clinic. have been on methadone for 10 years, around year 6 I started gaining weight and having mood changes, ive always struggled with depression but nothing like this. I have a great job making 250k/yr, just bought a house things were going well, still depressed and my work was slipping but I was ok. 
I started using hydros while on methadone (90mg hydromorphone contin IV DAILY), tired of going up in dose instead of down, I wasn't sleeping at night due to the pain, and again affecting my work. I had an amazing trip i was supposed to take for work that was a huge opportunity for my career, and couldn't because of methadone. at this point I snapped and had enough, I went into my doctors office and demanded to he put on sublocade due to the good things I've heard, he started me microdosing suboxone, withdrawals were unbearable for weeks, I started using again to help with the withdrawls, after getting to 18mg suboxone a day he stopped the methadone, still experiencing some withdrawal symptoms. the suboxone doesnt help at all with the pain, my MAT doctor sent me to another doctor who prescribed hydromorphone contin 2x daily which I'm taking orally - still in pain. besides all that I'm more depressed than I've ever been can't get up and do anything, no energy, I feel like I'm in a dream state all the time, what other treatment options exist for people like me, I feel like pain management ive got a life sentence on MAT..

"Bag empty, what to do now?? ",2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hpu1kf/bag_empty_what_to_do_now/,"I Had a small baggie of H (maybe about 0.75 g as I got shorted bad....)....spread it out over about a week but before that was taking about 1-4mg of Suboxone (not subutext) a day (would say about a third of  the time I snorted it the others sublingual....was taking 2-4 mg/day SL for most part then started lowering and skipping days to try to get off then trying manipulate so I could actually feel *something* but it left me wanting more....)
I can try to order something, but it wouldn't be here today and don't got connects really where I live. I could buy some kratom or 7-oh at the head shop, but funds are low for sure (cheaper than buying another bag though IF I can even find...less riskier though for sure and faster).
AlI have is Suboxone (8 mg pills and a 12 mg strip broken into about 2 mg squares but they are also dry). I also have 300 mg gabapentin that I took 2 of this morning (usually take 1 a day but lately been 2-6, prob 2-3 average) as well as flexeril and baclofen (don't think you are suppose to combine the 3 of those? I got the gabs originally though to stop the baclofen cus messed my GABA receptors up with it coming out of a lyrica binge months ago, but was originally given it for pain 
Since the flexeril makes me tired....unfortunately I will take more than I should and even 2 days taking 20-30mg I have to have something to fall back on otherwise my usually emotionally unstable self gets more volatile and downright scary). Also have 50 mg of hydrozyzine/vistaril, but that me tired and then groggy the next day (maybe I could split it up with my scale?). Celebrix/celocobix I take daily for pain already (it's like a strong ibuprofen but works better for my arthritis as it's selective). I have 650 mg extended release Tylenol (labeled for arthritis pain), immodium, pepto, 1mg clonazapam, the shitty manufacturer (not Pressies, I get them from my dr but im stuck with 1 specific pharmacy cus the chain doesn't like how my Dr writes scripts and flagged me...I am pretty low right now though and appointment is pushed out from holidays so have to use sparingly.) I take adderal for adhd also and need a minimum of 30 mg just to get up in the morning. I have a whole freaking big bag of pharms so could have something else that would help, who knows.
I Used the last little bit of the H last night/early morning (like a point or less) well tried to, but didn't feel anything (didn't want to snort cus little left, tried to iv but my veins suck and don't have much experience there, and didn't have stuff to attempt to boof with). Last time I took Suboxone was 23rd or 24th I think and took enough h for a light buzz Saturday night/early Sunday morning (also had been mixing with some coke every day). 
Starting to feel off now with loose stool, more tired than usual, sniffles, body temp changes it feels (also a bit worried about any possible infection from the 3-4 times I tried to stick myself....only had an old but unused insulin needle stashed away and while I tried to wash my arms and heat the needle to sterilize it, it felt pretty blunt and would bend easily...I dug around a bit though also trying find a vein but could never get return...yes, I'm stupid I know...I tried to shoot only once a few years ago but missed and had a lump for awhile cus injected part of it so was t going try to inject period without knowing for sure....).
I know if I take the sub and some got in my system last night or is still there from before, I risk PW. If life permitted, I wouldn't even mind going back to rehab or detox but I can't really if I want an income right now, which I really need....also could really use some sort of help mentally and rehab was the only place that helped (psych hospitals make me worse). I keep going in circles also cus like I want off the sub but worry I'll just get hooked again either cus I'm in pain or cus I relapse on something). Methadone would actually help my pain compared to Suboxone, but I can't go to a methadone clinic everyday for months on end either....",12/30/24 18:38,

Beta Endorphins & Spinal Injuries: Could Opioids Replace a “Broken” Natural System?,4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hpk26m/beta_endorphins_spinal_injuries_could_opioids/,"I’ve come to believe that, for some of us with spinal injuries or CSF dysfunction, opioids might function much like insulin does for diabetics—filling a true physiological need rather than simply covering up pain. Here’s the reasoning:
Endorphin Deficiency: Our bodies produce beta endorphins (natural opioids) to keep pain, stress, and mood in balance. But spinal trauma and chronic inflammation can break that system, leaving us deficient and struggling with far more than pain—fatigue, depression, and a feeling that our bodies just aren’t “right.”
Replacing What’s Missing: Just as a diabetic needs insulin to regulate blood sugar, we may need opioids to replace our missing endorphins and restore normal function. This isn’t about “chasing a high”—it’s about achieving maintenance levels so we can live a decent life.
Mislabeling Patients: Many people who’ve been called “opioid addicts” or “drug seekers” could actually be suffering from an endorphin deficiency due to spinal or CSF issues. Likewise, some who are labeled “depressed” may just need proper homeostatic support from something that acts like the body’s own opioid system.
Why It Matters: If we start viewing certain opioid therapies as legitimate maintenance treatments for those with documented endorphin deficits, it could reshape prescribing practices and reduce stigma. We need focused research—measuring endorphin levels, tracking CSF changes—to confirm this theory and help people get the care they truly need.
This perspective could transform the debate around opioids for spinal injuries. By recognizing a genuine physiological shortfall, we might finally treat patients with dignity and precision—rather than assuming their motive is addiction when it might just be survival. Let’s push for more studies and a more compassionate approach to prescribing. We all deserve relief—and respect.

The fact is that im at this point:everyone around me judge me as a bad or lazy  person,and i never judged any of my friends or family members for their addiction or problems.
When i was 5 yrs old i was abused,i was bullied my whole life for my body,and i never finded real love in this life.

I can up my dose of just 5mg,so it wold be 30mg everyday and it could be slightly better,but there is a part of me that just want to completly nodd and like sleep for ever,cause my brain keeps bringing back all the childhood trauma and other bad stuff.
I also think that 30mg everyday is not enough,if i could choose,i would take 40mg two times everyday,just to dont think about how sad this life is,and it was sad too when i was sober,even worse.

I got on suboxone for a little bit, then thought I could manage chipping away. Taking dilaudid for two or three days of the week, then waiting a day and taking subs for the rest of the week. Then the dills dried up again and I tried cold coping, was sold fentanyl. Said fuck it and went on a week long bender with that poison. Ran out, and naively took a sub the following morning. Got thrown into precipitated withdrawals. Went through that, got back on subs, then finally made the decision to get on sublocade.
 It seemed like my life was turned around, I felt cured on sublocade. I started saving money, started planning a trip. Got a third injection and flew to Vietnam. Travelled around south east Asia for the better part of a year. 
Eventually I had to come back. That was in September. As soon as I got back I got another sublocade injection. Then as soon as winter started to rear its ugly head, and I was due for another injection, I denied it…. I figured I could manage without it… but in reality I was just planning my relapse.
Now here I am, three months later, and I’ve been using 2-3 times a week on average. The last week I used 5 out of 7 days, and today I’m finally feeling what I can describe as full blown cravings paired with mild withdrawals for the first time in a year.

Pre-cip WDS,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hovivf/precip_wds/,"Okay so I have been on subs for almost 2 months now ( which by the way was a nightmare to accomplish but here I am ) so anyways my Dr. Had a brilliant idea to tell his patients they no longer can prescribe (most people) alprazolam anymore.. me being one of those people. So now I dont feel normal without them. So I took my little 22 minute trip to philly yesterday and grabbed some. Buuuuut I was tempted and got  D AKA fet and tranq. I purposely didnt take a sub that day and I had only gotten 5 bags... I did 2, 2 days ago and than I did the last 3 yesterday. So I'm on day 3 without taking any subs. I did my last bag at 3AM this morning so it's only going on about 5 hours. My question is if I only did 5 and accidently spread them out in 2 days.. when will it be safe to take my subs again without sending myself into pre-cip. Google says 72 hours with fet and I'm assuming that's with like a full blown habit. I know the WDs are gonna be nothing when they come on compared to what it's like coming off with a habit (my worst nightmare) but I'm still so mad at myself that I'm gonna have to wait til I feel shitty. But I just don't wanna send myself into pre-cip and than really be up shits creek. Someone told me since I have subs built up in my system I can take it as normal but I don't trust that for one second. Idk I've never been ""clean"" in 16 years up until now (clean with MAT) so I really dunno how this works... especially since it's not H anymore it's the tranq and fet cause I know with that the rule is 24 hours but back in 2012 I waited like 39 hours and I still got sent into precipitated WDS. and than other times I'd wait 24 hours and take a small piece and still get thrown into it. So basically what I'm saying is I'm scared shit-less but don't wanna be regular dope sick either and with a small slip up how long should I wait to take my subs wether it be a full one, a half or even just a sliver? 😬",12/29/24 12:59,

For context, I have sniffed H (came back as fent and morphine actually, so that’s what i got) for over 5 years. this past Sunday, i waited almost 20 hrs since last use and took the first subutex/pure bupe, and still went into horrible horrible PWD. had to spend the night in the ER, miss christmas, the works. 
I have felt like absolute trash ever since Sunday. it’s VERY slowly gotten better mostly bc the PWD ended after like 24 brutal hours, and i’ve been slowly regaining the color in my face, my ability to speak coherently, open my eyes, but i’m still struggling to stand/walk like at ALL, i have not eaten in 5+ days, barely sleeping, can barely function and have to go back to work in a matter of days. i have no clue how i’m gonna pull this off.
I’m currently on 8mg bupe 3x/day so 24mg/day. have been regularly dosing at least that (tuesday was a couple extra bc so sick) since Monday night. did not go into PWD again when i started again Monday, thank god, but it had been well over 24hrs since use. so today is day 5 of regular bupe.
My cravings are horrible. I am feening like an animal. I have almost a full bun left (7 bags) and a couple blue 30s, maybe a couple tramadol 50s too. I cannot bring myself to flush them. Is there any method i could take any of these things without risking PWD? or is it just another shot in the dark? when i was using, i was sniffing minimum a bun a day. sometimes two. could usually nod off about half a bun, 4-6 bags. 
i don’t know if my tolerance has really changed over 5 days. i’m trying so hard to keep from using at all. but i at least want to know any helpful information as far as preventing PWD. i cannot do that again. not for at least, a very long time.
Please any tips, insight or experience will be very valuable to me. I don’t have many people i can talk to about this. and this is my first real (greater than one day) attempt at MAT. and i absolutely hate it. 
Edit: A few other questions I have, 
1. if anyone knows any way to make the mf enormous sublingual tablet any less disgusting to dissolve, please share. I’ve been trying to get the films but have not been able to through my pharmacy, at least not without switching to suboxone which i’m nervous could be another PWD situation, whether just from the switch from subutex or using. 
2. how can i not be on this shit for the rest of my life? taper down the dose? i’ve heard people who got more hooked to bupe than H or fent. 
3. how difficult might it be to get a benzo scrip on top of bupe, subs or methadone? im trying to switch from the Ambien I am currently on for sleep, to Ativan for better sleep and anxiety. is this a huge no bc of the reactions or is it possible when done right?

recently I had a relapse after I had been one and a half months without opiates. I started using occasionally about a year ago although I always seem to binge for 2-8 days sometimes. 
the opiate I started using was DHC and I used seven days ago two times, wasn’t so bad, waited and now since 24 dec I haven’t stopped for five days, mostly due to fear of withdrawal though I know this time my doses and have a chance to taper, but i’ve always dropped cold turkey just because my dumbass brain though one couldn’t taper with opiates, and rather that would intensify withdrawal and overall increase side effects. idk why, but that always had been my logic, so here I would like to confirm how I could do my taper (maybe first cut by 50%, and then by 10%-20%)
and if it is actually a good idea, and could help.

28th: 150mg 
my doses haven’t exceeded 200mg 
how much do tapers help? if done properly. 
 
Could a kind of fast taper, due to the short period of consumption, help? Like tomorrow or when the wds start to kick in I could take 75mg and dic 30 50mg and dic 31 only 20. Or something like that. 
if you have any other tips i would be grateful.

Codeine ceiling dose/effects Question ,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ho4n4w/codeine_ceiling_doseeffects_question/,"So as we all know codeine has a ceiling dose of between 300-400mg where anything over that can't be metabolised into morphine and won't increase euphoria etc.
My question is this - how long does it take for this ceiling effect to ""reset"" (for lack of a better term)? Is 300-400mg the maximum that can be metabolised in something like a 24hr period, or is it per dose e.g after 6 hours or so once effects from an initial dose are subsiding  another dose can still be effective?
I've looked into it but haven't been able to find any definitive answers.
Obviously everyone's physiology is different so I'd imagine there might not be a concrete answer here.
Also as a side note if it makes any difference I'm lucky to be a ""hyper converter"" of codeine so despite dabbling in more than my fair share of opiates/oids over the years I still get a pretty pleasant buzz from codeine, strangely though the 2 or 3 times I've tried dihydrocodeine I didn't seem to get any real noticeable effect, but that could have been due to tolerance at the time and/or the dose being too low.
If there's a more appropriate sub to ask this on please let me know.
P.S please, if you're just going to chime in and say ""codeine is shit tier opiate, just do oxy"" please just scroll on by, I enjoy codeine, I know it's a very weak opiate, but just because it doesn't do anything for you doesn't mean other people shouldn't be allowed to enjoy.

"6 weeks of opiate binge, zero withdrawal",18,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hnnce7/6_weeks_of_opiate_binge_zero_withdrawal/,"I used heroin, methadone, oxycodone daily for this past month and a half. 
Up to a gram of H or up to 120mg of oxy or up to 120mg of methadone, never skipping a day.
This was my longest binge ever, and what surprised me it was double than my last binge I had couple years ago, where withdrawal symptoms were very apparent, albeit short (after using 3g of 92% pure H over 22 days), most annoying of which were hyperosmia and RLS.
Since I was expecting withdrawals, I loaded up on immodium, pregabalin, xans and diazepam, as well as a lot of vitamin C, multivitamins and everythint else that I thought would be necessary.
24 hours after my last dose I loaded up on multivitamins and didn't want to use any meds unless absolutely necessary.
The only thing that happened was four days of acute depression (slept 16h a day, most common for me after a binge since opioids barely let me sleep) and very short ejaculation time.
How is this possible? Anyone had similar experience? 
My gear being bunk is not the case, I was high AS FUCK every day.

I stayed sober from opioids for a year simply because I couldn’t get my hands on any, yet during that entire year, it never left my mind. The moment I managed to get more, I relapsed.
I have a job, and I limit myself to taking it once a week as a reward. But it would be a lie to say I don’t constantly think about the next dose. Right now, I’m high on ODSMT (and it feels so good, I feel so comfortable, like I’m back in my mother’s womb). My first experience was with Tramadol and Oxycodone, and I believe trying them was the biggest mistake of my life because it opened Pandora’s box.

They are pressed but I'm 80% sure they only have the 4 amphetamine salts in them (no methamphetamine) as they are noticeably weaker than other """"Adderall"" I've bought and the vender lists all four salts in the description. 
My question, I know adderall does interact with release endorphins (dopamine).  But I think there are multiple typed of dopamine...?
Will taking adderall prolong my paws. Im not really a fan of stimulants but compared to the hellish paws I've been going through... It's way better.

Dilaudid after spine dislocation & severe multiple herniations,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hn44fq/dilaudid_after_spine_dislocation_severe_multiple/,"So, I have hEDS. I’m 28, have had both knees replaced by the time I was 21, a full chest wall reconstruction surgery due to my slipped ribs, experience weekly dislocations, along with a lot of other pain and Eds symptoms. About two weeks ago for the first time I dislocated my spine, which caused 3 different herniated discs along with other symptoms (severe sciatica, etc)
I have a very wonderful pain management doctor who prescribed me 2-4mg of dilaudid every 4-6 hours. I’ve needed them very badly as the pain is horrific and unbearable, and I have a very high pain tolerance. But due to my ehlers danlos, I metabolize medication and it stops working very quickly. It’s about 12 days since the initial injury and the dilaudid is only about 60 percent effective at this point. Better than nothing but still, I’d like it be more effective. 
I was thinking about taking a “holiday” from it for a few days to see if that will up its efficacy. Is it safe to stop taking it after two weeks or is there a likelihood of dependency at that point? I have been through withdraws before (before my Chestwall surgery I was on opioids for about a year and weaned myself off with the support of my pain management doctor.) I really just want to stop cold turkey for a few days do reset my tolerance, but I don’t want to be in excruciating pain AND going through withdrawals. Please let me know your thoughts and experiences. 
Also, is there anyway if I switch up the pain meds, see if my pain management Dr can prescribe oxy or Vicodin or something, but I don’t know if just switching the medication will be effective if I’m already experiencing a lack of efficacy in the dose, and they’re all the same class of drugs. Any answers are GREATLY appreciated. 
Thanks so much!

"Hypocrisy, Generational Adiction/Trauma, and The Blame Game.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hn295j/hypocrisy_generational_adictiontrauma_and_the/,"I want to start by saying that I wish there was a way to explain this all in a (TL,DR) kind of way, but there are so many moving parts, different time lines, and fingers being pointed that I apologize in advance for how long  and thorough this is all is..
Basically, as a child I always knew my family wasn't normal. My father tool long trips, I wouldn't sleep some of those nights when I knew he was expected home. Id climb the cupboards searching for frosting, cake frosting, or any other sugary sweets. I learned be stealth like, quiet, careful, controlling my breathe. Who knows if my likness of sweets that late while waiting was some sort of coping mechanism, but that video games, music, and other adrenaline pumping activities became a fixation for me.
As I got older I noticed my parents fighting alot, My older brother beating on me and being extremely cruel as his own form of entertainment and amusement for his friends and himself..
Now at this point in my life I could hardly hear or speak well. There was a cyst in my left ear feared to be cancerous. Maybe this is why i latched onto my father like I did, who knows, I'm no psychological scholar, just something I studied for days, sometimes weeks at a time later in life after being diagnosed with so many different mental illnesses ranging from Conduct Disorder to MDD and GAD.
I wanted to be just like my father, emulated his every mannerism, tone of voice, speaking style, etc. I never felt entirely close to my mother though, more of an obligation or a nusciance. A doll to dress up, a prop in her life really and this feeling multiplied after the divorce.
My brother was always quick to make friends, slightly michevous, clever, but not very book smart, manipulative, and prone to lying, creating entire scenarios out of thin air to justify his own misdeeds. Regardless, after the divorce, I felt like we had to stick together. 
(I'm gonna jump around alot to help better understand the behavior of my family members)
Our mother, was a bartender, a server, a caretaker, etc. Jobs that many housewives might take on to help with finances or to excercise some independence, but overall she always had a habit of finding men, successful ones, and latching to them, using whatever skills of manipulation, sex appeal, gaslighted, etc these men into feeling lucky to have her, although eventually they'd all cheat on her. She has very up and down emotional fits, small digs at your self esteem, etc to the point where she over played her hand and these men would find other means of release. 
She grew up in a household with an abusive alcoholic father, he would, according to her, best her three brothers, and ""emorionally"" abuse her.
Those three uncles went on to develop alcoholism as well and all died from it, she's what her own therapist referred to as a ""weekend warrior"" and as fate would have it, this is where she met her partners (my father, and her current BF, cocaine also played a heavy role in the first relationship with my father) they met in a bar my aunt (father's side) and her husband owned up until a stabbing outside the bar lost her the business after she divorced her husband.
Point being, this was sort of a survival pattern for my mother, but at least imo, her trauma would never allow her to be content with or even really understand how to just be a normal, stable housewive/mother. There always had to be some sort of problem, overreaction, or chaos, probably stemming from her own childhood experiences.
Now let's jump to me at about age 12, my brother and Inare latched kids. My father agreed to double child support payments on top of alimony so long as my mother agreed to stay home and raise us herself. No additional employment. She chose to become a bartender anyway on top of the extra income agreed upon.
I found myself covering for my brother constantly smoking weed, doing coke, drinking, cigarettes, pills and who knows what else (later we found out he had tried crack by age 15)
It was my responsibility to narc on him, but being alone with him there meant I would get the shit kicked out of me, faux strangling to the point of unconsciousness, shoved into a dryer and having it turned on, locked in car trunks, small closets, etc.
One day around age 14 I just woke up and on my way to the end of the street to get picked up for summer camp, I completely lost all control and beat the mailbox with my bare fists until they were bloody and through the backpack onto the roof. I felt so empty and depressed for the first time. Like I was becoming aware of how fucked up and unfair my life was. Idk what triggered it but I just couldn't take it anymore.
I never did a drug or drank a day in my life, I wanted so badly to get all straight A+s and get out of the life i was stuck in. But I was losing control of it all emotionally. I had to go to therapy, but that didn't seem to help much. At that age and onward many girls were interested in me but the fear of my mother and just how alien I felt kept me from really pursuing them back. I was such a confused, lonely and frustrated kid. 
My mother would constantly tell us our father didn't want us, he would breakdown drunk in front of me during visits and tell me how sorry he was for ruining everything. Life just sucked man. 
For the first time I felt completely out control like no matter how well I did in school, what job I ended up with what friends, or anything would make any of it better. Part of me loved my family so much, I was that naive kid who wanted to believe that one day dad would walk back through the door and all woukd be right again. Big happy Disney ending ya know?
But that isn't what happen, word got around school who and how my brother was, my mother and my father, I was picked on constantly and finally had to fight back. 
From that day foreword I started to always fight back not just with fists, but with words, with actions. I tried to take whatever control I could in anyway I could just never drugs or alcohol, however then internet became huge and porn became a central part of my life.
I literally fiendishly waited to go home and watch it for hours at a time. It got bad too. At first like any 14-15 year old male kid, just seeing tit's and ass was insanely riveting, but then I found out about lesbians? But even that too got dull, so I kept inching away at riskier and more taboo categories to the point where I was confused about my own sexualality. I felt so embarrassed because in real life I knew i wouldn't ever and couldn't do the things that seemed to turn me on in the moment. It was such a weird, confusing time that went on for years. I'd get heavy guilt then watch lesbian porn to ""even"" it out I guess? 
(Jumping forward several decades I realized the less I watched porn the more I'd stay at just normal porn, or none at all, and the less I watched the more natural I felt around women, whereas doing the opposite made me feel extremely guilty and like she must know somehow) 
Aside from video games and maybe caffinated soda this was my only addiction but much much stronger.
Around this time I experimented with weed and got caught pretty much immediately.  I got it from my bro and I brought it to school for a girl who liked me. I had a reputation that stemmed from my brother and family so she thought she needed to like weed for me to like her.
Her preppy friends found out and I was caught, during after school help of all things. 
She lied for me, but all my ""friends"" snitched immediately even though at this point I smoked weird maybe once or twice lol.
I got expelled and forced into a school with drug abusers, criminals, the mentally ill, etc.  my chances at a normal life were slipping away pretty fast.
Anyway I went on regular schooll eventually, my brother had his first kid, I finally lost my virginity despite my mother drilling it into my head that I ""better not knock any girl up and I'm not having any sex in her household!""
She was into percocet though, and honestly I didn't find her that attractive so it was a perfect way to slide out of the relationship guilt free, so I did. Lots of my freind were into pills around this time but I steered clear reading online that it was basically legal heroin.
Despite that, I felt like I would probably love opiates from the way they were described.
I was still very depressed too, working out and gaining more friends helped but my first percocet made me feel this incredible hope like maybe life could be goof after all so I begged my friends to keep them away from me. This was like right around the time that ""Relapse"" CD by Eminem came out and all the sudden everyone was doing OCs and Percocet, and on a few rare occasions, I even saw smack being lined up. (Who woulda known this would become normal a few years later)
*I guess at this point I'll speed up the story*
Basically, I got my first job, started doing blues (perc 30s) went to rehab 3 months later, learned about heroin, reached out to an aquantience from rehab a year later  when I relapsed, and started picking up dope to bring back to my small town where dope dealers were treated like rap stars. There were only a few of us and single bags went for 10-20, my competition was pissed cuz I did deals at 80 a bun and 10 a bag. I was charged 400 a stack (double what it costs) so I was using ripped off and still making 600 profit a stack. I did about 2-4 bags a day 7 was the most I ever did back then in a single day.
Eventually I got a sick of it all and paranoid about being arrested so I hit rehab again. Eventually I went on to go to rehab over 10 times and met a girl or two everytime. It became a habit in it of itself.
-‐-----------‐--------------------------------------
Okay so now let's jump to now...
----------------------------------------------------
My bro went to jail ended up there for 2 years for fraud, almost lost his kids, got them back and turned his life around. He's been clean for 10 years
My mom cut down on the drinking, upped on the food, her bf who owns a business and apartments cheats on her but she's in a denial. Not sure if she cares or not though, just think she knows how to play the system, not hard to see where my bro gets it from..
2 years ago I had a nervous breakdown after my freind killed his father an hour after dropping me off at my car and I found out my ex gf died randomly by searching her name on Google, add some conspiracy YouTube vids and multiply that by a nightshift job and psychosis hit me hard.
I managed to use a purposeful relapse to tap into state resources and get back on my feet.
I fell for a girl In rehab pretty hard and we relapsed together on f fentynal. I begged my mother for a rental so I could hustle money for a car note. I did Uber eats every waking hour while working at FedEx warehouse, used rhe fentanyl to work through It all, PF to take showers while living out of th rental, got accepted at an Amazon DSP and worked 5-6 days a week. 
Payed off the rental and got the new car, saw her once in a while, and racked up money to find a room to rent.
 
2 years later I was the sole name of the lease 10K in the bank 10K In My 401k new car 2024, and while all this time Mt family knew I was on fentynal they chose this Christmas to cut me out of their lives. Saying ""you looked so high"" even though for a year and half my brother had no idea I was getting high lmao. Suddenly now it's always been obvious.  My mom doesn't want me around anymore, guess I'm a dissapoinemnt now. Idk man to me?
When you consider everything I was forced to deal with despite just wanting a normal life, how am.i supposed to feel? For 2 and half years this was all fine, now apparently for 3 months it's ""been obvious""? 
It's the winter, I work at Amazon driving, we always look like shit around this time not to mention my SAD and trouble sleeping. This is the only year I've worked 5 days a week also. Its catching up with me. We've had guys and girls take entire months Inna row off for this very reason. It's a demanding job. But what really upsets me is that none of them seem to understand their roles or accept how their shifty choices effected me. I get high to not want to die everyday, for stamina, and for the tiny bit of euphoria I get from it. That's my business, they say to be an adult and suck it up, but then try to tell me how to live and judge tf outta me. 
For the first time in my life I genuinely don't care and kind of feel relieved that I don't have to care anymore. Fuck em. 
Can anyone relate to this?

He had encouraged her to abuse her pain medication, starting her addiction, and no one but me knows that.

Overdose experience? ,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hn0z2o/overdose_experience/,When i had overdosed . I personally have no memory of this. All is what ive been told.

He said he couldn't get any oxygen in me. He i wasnt moving. I wasn't breathing. He tried to admistrate the narcan and i wouldnt be moving but as soon as he would try to do it.  I would start freaking out.  I was try to stop him. He believes i have a demon that wants to kill me and is trying to kill me. Because every time he as tried to use narcan. I would try to stop him.  Then i would go back to not breathing. He said i started to have convulsions . He said i was screaming . I have no memory of this . He then gave me a another narcan. He said he would pray over my body . He would hit my chest.  Try breathing into my mouth. But i wasnt breathing. I had my mouth open. I wasnt moving.  He didnt think the second one was enough. I dont know how long it lasted.  The only memory i have had is me trying to cover my nose. But i don't understand why i would try to stop him. I just vaugly remember seeing my hand come up to my nose freaking out and then i dint remember anything else. Hes very traumatized by this.  Ive tried looking up waking up in the middle of an overdose but nothing comes up. I don't understand what happened. Why i would try to stop someone from saving my life?  He would tell me to breathe.  Take deep breaths.  He was begging for me to stay alive.  He was doing anything and everything he could think of. Has anyone had any similar experience.  Does Anyone know whats going on. Is there something wrong with me. And hes told me in the past i have had similar overdoes in the past but i would be fine for a few hours after smoking and like 2 hours later i would overdose. I would lose consciousness. I hate that hes had to go thur this.  I have no emotional connection to my overdoses. I dont have feeling about it. Maybe the only emotion i have is denial.

Any idea why I don’t respond to opiates?,4,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hmxcqn/any_idea_why_i_dont_respond_to_opiates/,"I’ve never experienced what people say opiates do, and maybe not even what they are supposed to do (both recreationally and for pain management). In the 90s I tried tons of times to get high on hydros and never worked, if I took too many I’d just feel dizzy and nauseous. Shot heroin with a buddy about 20 years ago…he got high AF and. I just puked a bunch, no euphoria whatsoever, and felt like I had the flu that night and the day after.
I’ve had a few minor surgeries in the last few years that came with Percocet in the past. Only one time I remember feeling kinda more interested in life and content (taken only as prescribed). 
I had a more invasive surgery and when I woke up I was screaming in pain as if there wasn’t any IV pain management happening at all. The next time I had a similar surgery I mentioned this and got a nerve block first (that maybe didn’t work) and the same torturous 10+/10 happened. They had to give me so much IV (morphine I’m guessing?..not sure what the use at the hospitals now) that my blood pressure dropped too low and they had to stop. 
Now, I’m no sissy - I have really high pain tolerance, military etc. I can suck it up. But this was next level horror. Was sent home with hydromorphone, which I took VAST quantities of and even got a refill. Never once felt anything different/pleasant even after the pain was gone. I guess it’s good I can’t get high because of all the fentanyl crap, but now I’m also terrified to ever have surgery again. 
Oh, and I get insomnia and more energy when I take pain pills, which now and then I’ll take up to 15-40mg hydro to get housework done. Never done frequently or enough to develop tolerance and haven’t had to go withdrawals (I know what a huge blessing this is; I wouldn’t wish that on anyone). So clearly they do something, just not sure what or why.

I'm ready to quit and give it up due to the costs, 1x 40mg oxycontin cost me about $100 aud so my weekly cost is around $700 
I've managed to keep myself on 40mg without going over for years and years despite it not having the magic it used to have in hopes that I won't ruin it for myself and I think I've done well in keeping to a low dose. The past few months I've noticed that I'm beginning to crave it a bit more or 2 times a day and with the cost of things it's just not manageable 
My question is how do I give myself the best chance at quitting and how long does withdrawals last? 
I've never really gone through withdrawals really and whenever I've felt it I fix myself up so I'm not to sure how bad it's going to be co spidering the low amount of withdrawal time I've experienced was agony
So I just want to give myself the best chance and will welcome on any advice to help me, is the withdrawal severity based on the amount you take or the overall time you've been taking it or a mix of both?

Monday I went to the ER because I was experiencing some significant abdominal pains. They performed a CT scan and it turns out that pounding miralax for nearly 4 days straight  completely liquified the moderately sized hard stool inside me.
They told me not to worry, I won't need to be disimpacted manually. Just stop taking the laxative and poop normally.

Do opioids really only make you care less about pain? Or do they actually reduce the feeling itself as well?,0,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hmejqd/do_opioids_really_only_make_you_care_less_about/,"I've never had the opportunity to use opioids for actual physical pain, since before I found them never got them prescribed, then I find them and immediately get hooked, then after 2-3 years of everyday use no dose does anything for physical pain (that I would attempt, at least), and for those 2-3 years never had any pain, so even for mild/moderate daily pains like a flu or whatever I've never used them, nsaids have always worked.
But I'm extremely curious, because I see a lot of people saying that they don't really take away the pain, they just make you care less about it. Which isn't really in accordance with most studies that I've been reading, when for example IV morphine or fentanyl is used for even quite severe pains, like broken bones and what not, and the pain not unusually goes from a 9/10 to a 3 or 4/10 after 10-20 minutes or so, which is a huge difference right? So how can this be related to only caring less about the pain?
Whereas nsaids (when they work) people do tell that they actually remove the pain (or part of it).
As a side note, it's also interesting that after stalking pulmonary embolism and kidney stone forums, due to health fears, it was very common to hear the story of ""morphine/fentanyl injection didn't do anything to me at the ER, but as soon as they injected the ketorolac (a potent nsaid) the pain was all gone"". Of course for some people it's the opposite, the ketorolac does nothing and only the opioids work. But for some reason I feel like the former are in higher numbers, aka I sometimes feel that opioids may be overrated, just from the many empirical cases that I've read over the years. I feel like strong IV nsaids are stronger, as well as ketamine (yes, in low doses it seems to be an excellent painkiller.)",12/26/24 2:12,

Can somebody explain to me how taking a full opioid agonist like oxycodone or fentanyl can bring on precipitated withdrawal if you’re already taking Suboxone? ,2,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hlxgrs/can_somebody_explain_to_me_how_taking_a_full/,"As I understand it, Suboxone contains buprenorphine and naloxone.

It also binds much stronger to the receptor than other full opioid agonists (oxycodone, heroin, etc). 
I understand why precipitated withdrawal would occur if the oxycodone were taken first (because the buprenorphine would bind to the occupied receptors but produce a weaker effect), but I don’t understand how it works the other way around. If buprenorphine binds more tightly to other receptors, wouldn’t taking another opiate simply just have zero effect? What is the mechanism I’m missing here? ",12/25/24 9:16,

Perusing YouTube I decided to check on one of my favorite content creators. Still no upload. Strange. I go to their most recent video and open the comments.
The day of the upload many people raised an eyebrow. One of the people on this channel was clearly high. I was one of the first to recognize it and call it out as I was watching the video within 30 minutes of upload. I wasn't judging the guy. I was just being honest and if anything thought I'd enjoy a conversation with him just as a fellow opioid enjoyer. I didn't know for sure he was into them, but when watching the video I was fairly certain. We know the look. Anyways I finished the video, and my gaming, and eventually went to bed.
This morning I discovered that night the person in question overdosed and died. I immediately got a lump in my throat and ran to my comment history trying to find my comment hoping to god I was mistaken and maybe I actually made the comment after he had overdosed. Nope. I was in fact one of the earliest ones to mention it.
I know many of you are thinking that I am being silly or dramatic. Perhaps. I have always felt guilt to be the heaviest burden to bear.

Kratom is... better than I remember?,6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hltbja/kratom_is_better_than_i_remember/,"Hey all. Merry Christmas!
So since I had 3 months in a row where my Oxycodone 15mg wasn't in stock and I couldn't save extra- my brother gave me Kratom. Years ago I remember when I had bad withdrawals i purchased some which did help the withdrawals. I never took a big amount , mainly because it was a small bag of tablets. 
Anyway, this is the red one I guess the main strain speciosa mitro. So I saw doses range tremendously and some people say they take insane amounts. But I have 1/4 KG he gave me. It's tested and the brand checks out. 
So at night, I am able to skip both my final dose of Adderall , Oxycodone and Valium. I take 16 tablets so 8g. It says to take 4 tablets but I see online that has stimulant effects in low doses. 
I don't understand why this isn't a medicine in the US and I do understand why it's used in Asia. I am on SO many medications for adhd, cPTSD and chronic pain. This seems to be a miracle drug. 
For me, it is like taking a high dose of caffeine, mixed with a Vicodin and a very high dosage of Valium. I do take a few extra tablets sometimes so it's between 7g-10g. I use it to replace my final dosages so I save pills for backorder issues. 
I'm so used to all my medications I don't feel ""high"" anymore. I just feel okay. The Kratom works sooo fast and since I take it at night I don't need it to last too long. But i just wanted to say it's not a placebo like some told me. 
I'm  not wanting to raise my tolerance so I take it by itself. And I get the well-being feeling that the ""peak"" of Oxycodone brings me but it seems to maintain itself for about 2 hours. It helps with sleep and helps my neck and back pain. 
TLDR;
This stuff is a miracle. It genuinely helps me not require my final dosage of all three medications. At this amount it has both stimulant and pain relieving effects. It truly is much better than I remembered and expected. ",12/25/24 4:03,

"You aren't ""clean"" you are abstinent",111,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hlg010/you_arent_clean_you_are_abstinent/,"The way we talk about opiates and opioids needs to change. Calling someone “clean” because they’ve stopped using these substances is not only stigmatizing—it’s inaccurate and harmful.
Here’s why this matters:
Not all use is addiction. Opiates (natural substances like morphine and codeine) and opioids (synthetic or semi-synthetic drugs like oxycodone and fentanyl) are used for pain relief, recreation, or dependency management. Assuming all users are “dirty” creates unnecessary shame.
“Clean” implies moral judgment. Using opioids or opiates doesn’t make someone “dirty.” This language unfairly paints all use—whether recreational, medical, or dependent—as negative or immoral.
It erases nuance. Dependence, addiction, and responsible use are different experiences. Using judgmental terms like “clean” oversimplifies these distinctions and stigmatizes everyone.
The better word to use is “abstinent.” It’s neutral, factual, and doesn’t carry the moral or emotional baggage of “clean.”
By changing how we talk about opioid and opiate use, we can foster a more supportive and respectful environment—one that acknowledges the complexity of these substances and the people who use them.
Words matter. Let’s focus on respect, not stigma.

"I hate that I'm much more mentally stable on opioids, for 7 years already",9,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hlewel/i_hate_that_im_much_more_mentally_stable_on/,"Even though I stopped (or stopped being able to afford) getting high only after 2 or 3 years, I'm still way more mentally stable. I think I've always been dopamine deprived. And then I started taking benzos everyday due to life problems, and became straight anhedonic, unable to get pleasure from anything. Starved of pleasure. Then suddenly you discover these cheap pills with no hangover or any bad side effects that make you feel absolutely godly... How can you not fall for it?
But even though I still feel much more mentally stable today, I still regret it. For one thing: these things don't fuck any organ like most other drugs, but they fuck your brain's dopamine production and pain management system. So if you ever stop you'll become much more dopamine deprived than ever (for 6-24 months, the so called PAWS, but some people just never quite heal), plus you'll become less resistant to pain, plus opioids won't work for pain management while on active addiction.
These are imo pretty bad things and totally not worth the trade off. I think maybe it would have been worth it if I had stayed at a low dose, like 50mg of oxy a day or equivalent, and definitely never mess with methadone/subs which really mess your receptors, or so I suspect. Plus also adding a tolerance reversing drug from the start, like agmatine or ULDN.
I know these are like first world problems to those living in North America, which is becoming more and more third world (the fentanyl problem, among many others), but for those of us in Europe where it's still possible to acess safe opioids, I give the advice of never getting hooked. I thought it was worth it, specially for people like me, but it still isn't. There's other ways to solve depression.",12/24/24 14:42,

Relapse question,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hlcp62/relapse_question/,"I have been addicted to opioids for years. Heroin, suboxone, methadone you name it. I quit the hard stuff 1.5 years ago and replaced it with kratom. Eventually, that spiraled out of control as well to the point of using 50-70 grams a day for the last 6 months. A few days a week I also added subs/methadone/heroin to the mix. I quit cold turkey a month ago and used suboxone for the first 5-7 days. Due to insomnia and anxiety, I have used lots of gabaergics and benzos (mainly phenibut and lyrica) for the past couple of weeks. Bad choice as upon quitting them a few days ago, I have had horrible mental rebound. Which together with the opioid paws have been hell. Yesterday I was completely burned out with hellish depression and anxiety and could do nothing but lay in bed. Figured I ""needed"" something to do the chores in preparation for christmas. Found a 8 mg suboxone and railed half of it up my nose. Felt fine after about 30 mins and did all my chores. Today I took the other half just to ""be fine on christmas"". You know how us addicts reason... Now I'm ashamed and also terrified of what this relapse might do to my progress. On to the questions:
1. How much will this 2 day relapse set me back after being off opioids completely for over 3 weeks? Will I be ""fine"" except for increased depression/anxiety/restlessness/insomnia for a couple of days? Or will I be back to full blown withdrawal?
2. How do I manage the cravings? It feels impossible for me not to relapse when I get these cravings. Having that utterly horrible withdrawal anxiety and knowing dosing will take care of it in an instant. I become a f*ckin robot, programmed to finding and dosing opioids! I have no one to talk to when shit gets rough, which makes it even harder to try and do it on my own. But I really want to get clean. But seems impossible with these long withdrawals and cravings :(

How long until I can chip again,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hlbvj5/how_long_until_i_can_chip_again/,"So..
I have currently 4 days clean from a high dose iv o-DSMT habit and I feel pretty much normal today, no shivering no sweating no RLS I just feel exhausted.
I have decided that sobriety is not an option for me right now because I still love the feeling way too much (check out my post history.. not my first rodeo) and I still have access to opiates/opioids legally and cheap (severe genetic auto**inflammatory** disease with severe pain issues) I get 200 20mg IR oxy capsules every month and more to a certain extent if I simply ask for them..
I will not touch o-DSMT or any opioid that I can use iv every again and will simply just use my prescription as prescribed with the exception of a day or two every two weeks.
I have noticed that if I manage to stay clean until the physical withdrawal symptoms are mostly gone and I use again (3-4 day) I wake up in full withdrawal the next morning.
So.. how long do I have to be clean until I am not physically addicted anymore so I can chip every two weeks?
Any insight is appreciated.. and please no lectures.. I have been an addict for many years at this point with multiple instances of months long clean phases but sobriety just does not work for me and MAT or subs are not an option for me in this country because I will lose my job (pharmaceutical industry)

21 Grams of Fentanyl To Remember You By,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hk19q8/21_grams_of_fentanyl_to_remember_you_by/,"# Everybody Was My Friend…Until They Became My Customer.
The year draws to a close, and the ritual of taking stock begins. Not of inventory, not of profit margins, but of the faces that still grace this mortal coil. A grim audit of survival. For some, loss is a distant echo, a faded photograph in a dusty album. For me, it's a constant companion, a phantom limb that aches with every passing day. In the opioid game, intimacy arrives with brutal speed. Your confidantes become casualties. Your allies turn to whispers in the shadows, trading loyalty for a fix, or worse, *a deal with the devil in blue*.
The streets are paved with broken promises and the ghosts of those who OD'd in trap houses. You think you're clever, a puppet master pulling the strings of fate, mastering the alchemy of oblivion. Like that professor in ""*Candy,*"" you delude yourself into believing you're bringing solace, a temporary reprieve from the crushing weight of existence. But the truth, a bitter pill I’ve swallowed countless times, is this:
***Everybody was my friend… until they became my customer.***
*The Illusion of Control*
I could give it away. I did give it away, countless times. Late nights, backroom deals, ""*hooking a brotha up*""—gestures of misplaced generosity, desperate attempts to blur the lines between friend and client. But the truth remained, etched in the haunted eyes of those who came to me: ***I wasn't a friend. I was the gatekeeper.*** The one who held the key to their fleeting euphoria, and, unknowingly, to their eventual ruin.
I told myself I was controlling the market, a benevolent drug lord setting fair prices, ensuring a steady supply. “*I’m the market*,” I’d whisper to the empty rooms, a pathetic mantra of self-justification. I wasn’t some *Bindle 'N Bundle Bernanke*, manipulating interest rates of misery. I was the *architect of their dependence,* the *engineer of their destruction.* In the desolate landscape of my conscience, *only the ghost of Albert Speer kept me company*.
Where are they now, those faces from 2006, 2007? The ones who laughed with me, shared secrets, dreams? Gone. Vanished like smoke in the wind. Robert Graves had it right: ""*Goodbye to All That*.""
It’s not the abstract guilt of contributing to a national crisis that haunts me. It’s the *personal toll*, the faces I can no longer see, the voices I’ll never hear again.d It’s the first cut, the deepest, the one that sets the pattern for all the others. It’s the way relativity twists the knife: the closer they were, the sharper the pain. What does it mean to know that something you created, this fire you unleashed, reached out and consumed those closest to you? That’s my story. A cautionary tale for anyone who dreams of playing El Chapo with the universe.
\------------------------------------------------------
***December 29, 2004***
Before I was fully initiated into this brotherhood of selling suffering wholesale to gangs and distros, I knew its sting. My cousin, just two years older, a whirlwind of restless energy, had barely tasted freedom after a stint in county jail. His ""*Booster Bragging Rights*""—a juvenile escapade involving a stolen encrypted radio, an AR15 from a police cruiser, a military armory and stolen Javelin rocket launchers—had landed him there. Now, he was back, trying to find his footing, trying to outrun the demons that clung to him like shadows. He was working his way back up to 80 mg of Oxy, chasing the phantom of oblivion. That afternoon, he scored 40 mg of Methadone. One tablet. One dose. One fatal arrhythmia.
I was seventeen, a kid playing adult in a world I didn’t understand. My dad, bless his practical soul, had made sure we were all lifeguard certified. I knew CPR. I remember the frantic compressions, the forced breaths, the ""*Ice Queen*""—my aunt Theresa—taking over, her face a mask of frozen terror. I remember his saliva, still warm on my lips. He was gone. His bowl of cheerios lying spilled onto the floor. Leaking out, like his life force. Just like that. The weight of his lifeless body in my arms, the echo of his last breath, the image of his eyes, fixed and vacant—these are the memories that claw at me in the dead of night.
The train of devastation, the *Fentanyl Zephyr*, a phantom express carrying the weight of all my sins wasn't finished with me. It never is. It’s a ghost train that circles back like a celestial orbit, its mournful whistle echoing through the desolate landscape of my heart. It doesn't care about calendars or celebrations; it operates on its own cruel timetable. Years later, under the oppressive weight of another December night, it pulled into *Deandra Station* again, bringing with it another cargo of grief.
\---------------------------------------------------
***December 8, 2011***
A decade later. Another December. Another loss. Today is a day I try to erase from the calendar, a black hole in the fabric of time. The 1975’s “*Somebody Else*” plays on some random radio station and it all comes rushing back.
The memory of his last kiss, the cold saliva on even colder lips. That morning, he’d texted me, full of life, talking about steak dinners and my upcoming birthday. I’d sent him back a Gwen Stefani lyric, a desperate, unspoken plea: *I’d kill a dozen Santa Clauses, steal his sleigh, and come back home to you*. A hollow promise in retrospect.
That night, the aroma of beef brisket filled the air, a comforting scent that usually signaled warmth and connection. My favorite. He knew me so well. I called his name, the sound echoing strangely in the quiet house, as I began preparing the green beans, a familiar domestic ritual. Fifteen minutes ticked by, an eternity in the growing silence. A flicker of unease crept in. Maybe he was lost in the digital battlefield of *Call of Duty*, oblivious to the world outside the screen? I went to the man cave, a space usually buzzing with the sounds of virtual warfare. It was empty, a hollow echo chamber. A chill ran through me as I wandered back upstairs, drawn by a sliver of light spilling from an open door at the end of the dark hallway.
And that's where I found him. Lifeless. No breaths. No pulse. Cold, clammy skin. The frantic 911 call, the chest compressions, the Narcan, the Doxapram—a desperate, futile dance with death. ***How much epi in a code***? My mind screamed, but the knowledge was useless, a cruel mockery in the face of the inevitable. I had a literal pharmacy at my fingertips in my medic bag, but all the king's potions can't bring my Humpty back. I held him, tears streaming down my face, mingling with the coldness of his skin. ***Blue Lips, Pale Fingertips.*** The whispers began, the same insidious voices that haunted Hamlet, echoing in my mind: ***You’re too late. You’re too late. You’re too late.***
The contents of the safe, the evidence of my trade, went into a garbage bag. A ritual of destruction, a desperate attempt to erase my culpability. The charcoal briquettes, the lighter fluid, the match—*a moth drawn to the flame of my own guilt*.
***Twenty-one grams of fentanyl, reduced to ash, rising like a macabre phoenix from the flames, a twisted echo of Sadako's paper cranes, carrying his soul away from me, away from the world I had helped to destroy.***
When my time comes, will there be a Ferryman willing to guide this wretched soul across the River Styx? Or will I be left to wander the shores of regret, haunted by the faces of those I’ve lost, forever trapped in the echo of their last breaths?
*End the Drug War, so that monsters like me don't have to exist.*

I fly like the, crowbar in in Freeman's hands
Uneventful as my plans

My breathing needs to be depressed
Dry heave then saturate with sess
Sadness and hate filled up my chest
I Lost it all, In Sauce I fall. Will you answer when I call? 
If I die tomorrow tell my mother that I fucking hate her
Tell em that since 17 I've pissed hotter than the equator
Tell em all that I went crazy
Fuck it all, the doctor played me
Nothing but this mem’ry
On repeat for long enough for me
To yeet. 
I'm in the sheets, I'm at the shakedown at Jones Beach 
It's 4 o'clock and I'm feeling weak
Cactus until I fall asleep 
Stack smack in packs until I'm a rack of white bone

Unlike me as a person my plants have grown 
You can't draw blood from this stoned stone

Anybody encountered issues with Proton pump inhibitors and codeine?,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hk2xul/anybody_encountered_issues_with_proton_pump/,"Hi. Has anybody else encountered issues with codeine barely having any effect while using a proton pump inhibitor?

Anyway, I'm using Esomeprazole for my GERD at the moment and it so happens that codeine effectiveness has taken a nose dive.

Tolerance hasn't been an issue for 2 years now, but I barely feel anything right now, even from 60mg, pretty much since I started taking Esomeprazole. I found medical studies that show Esomeprazole acting as a weak CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor, that converts codeine to morphine, but it seems to completely kill any codeine conversion for me.

Bupenorphine and Alcohol,4,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hjmqpr/bupenorphine_and_alcohol/,"Who here takes Bupenorphine to quit drinking and also had a moderate opiate problem. 
I've been on Bupenorphine for two years. I'm weaning off because its given me horrible side effects such as low testosterone, bad depression, poor sleep, trouble urinating, constipation. I deal with those side effects with others medications but I still don't feel happy or like myself. So I'm down to 6mg bupe and jumping to 4mg next month. 
However, Bupenorphine is the only thing besides incarceration that has helped me stay sober from alcohol totally. I've been sober over two years and don't even desire to drink or be around people drinking. 
The Bupenorphine seems to act on the same receptors in the brain that alcohol affects. Yes I do feel dependent on the Bupenorphine and that's also why I want to get off. 
I have also abused pain killers. Never H or Fent. But my pain killer abuse was moderate and would only last up to a week if I had the source or a couple weeks if I had my own script. After the couple weeks I could stop taking them n did feel some withdrawal but not much. Id usually drink to deal. 
My drinkng problems tho were much more of a problem. 4x DUI which I did prison time for (7 Mos), relationship issues, went to work drunk a couple times, wake up and not stop drinking and just quit my job after conflict the previous day at work, saying and doing mean things that were not of my person at all, having sex with women I would never imagine seeing naked even lmao 🤣. They got a get some loving too, just glad I don't remember most of it besides passing out.

Family member passed away one week ago.  He was found with a few bags of meth and one bag of “a black tarry substance”.  This “substance” tested negative for heroin and all other drugs on the panel.  The coroner doesn’t know what else it could be.  Any ideas on what it could have been? 
Young, physically healthy.  We knew he was microdosing meth and vaped tobacco.  He appeared to be sleeping when we found him, sitting upwards, but his eyes were slightly open and he was cold to the touch.  Autopsy was negative but still have to wait 3 weeks for toxicology…however they do suspect overdose.
I thought meth overdoses were not typical.  Any ideas?  What of the black tarry substance that tested negative for drugs?

partner is 1 month sober! ,12,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hj92ho/partner_is_1_month_sober/,"Hey everyone.  
As the title says, my boyfriend has been sober from Percs and Oxys for the past 30 days. For the last 4 years, he’s been dealing with all types of painkillers, which led him to overdose and be hospitalized. Luckily, he survived after 3 consecutive heart attacks and was legally presumed dead for a couple of minutes.  
During his stay in the ER, he realized how much it had impacted me and his family life. To this day, he’s still trying to make amends and frequently apologizes by planning cute date ideas, which I missed a lot because the last 2 months were just a completely dark phase, especially with his excessive usage due to his paranoia, panic attacks, PTSD, and more.  
I know and I’m aware he has good intentions and wants to do better by my side every day, as well as for himself. But this event has impacted me a lot; the pain in his mom’s voice shattered my heart into pieces, and seeing him battle addictions in his hospital bed broke me.  
My father passed away a year before this incident happened with my partner.  I spent the evening at the ER, grieving. 
I hate the month of November now.  
To all my fellow friends who have been sober from opiates, can you please tell me how I should act towards him when he sometimes speaks about his urge to relapse?  
I tend to be emotional sometimes because I just think about those tragic events when he ""trauma dumps"" me from his POV. But I want to support him well. I love him dearly and I want to have a better approach. And yes, healing isn’t linear.  
I just feel like I’ve been on the edge lately, and I’m scared that I’m not helping his situation.

"Which detox from fentanyl is less painful, using Methadone or buprenorphine ?",1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hj4vgd/which_detox_from_fentanyl_is_less_painful_using/,"F30, 10+ yrs of heroin use (obviously found out its been mainly fentanyl the past 2-3 years. Xylazine detected too, I believe that's what really has made my body feel really sick.)  
Ideally, I don't want to be on anything and just detox completely.  
But, **I do not want to go to inpatient** (Ik it is the ideal option, but due to life circumstances, and honestly also had bad experiences with unsafe conditions/male staff.)
I recently did an at home detox following the same doses + meds as an inpatient detox: 7 day methadone taper (starting from 35mg, -5mg daily ). But relapsed almost immediately and have been back to using for these past 2 weeks since.  
I followed up on a hospital's referral to their chemical dependency department today. It advertised a buprenorphine 7-10 day detox, but I found out I must misunderstood the ""detox"" part. Not an ""outpatient detox"", its just an outpatient clinic similar to a methadone program (but with subs instead: sick for 2 days, come in daily for daily dose 7-10, once stabilized you get on script and don't need to come in daily, then slowly taper off over months). It's still something your body is dependent on, even if done with intention & motivation, will take some months to comfortably taper down and get completely off.)
The withdrawals using methadone to detox weren't the worst and I have experience with it (it changed my life before, but I can't deny ik it messes with my body. I just want to be free of having to be physically limited.) My only experience with subs is getting a script many years ago and I got sick as a dog likely from precipitated withdrawal. So **I have a lot of anxiety about subs having a more painful withdrawal process..** In my mind, if I need the willpower and go through the pain for 2 days, why not push through instead of just getting on something again that I'l have to withdraw from anyway (but drag it out longer..)?
I know there is no quick fix and both meds have changed peoples lives (methadone helped me when I hit rock bottom a few years ago), I understand I'll likely take months to feel ""normal"" again regardless and these meds are supposed to also help with cravings as you adjust and go down. But I'm so tired. Im worried about my body. That's why I desperately prefer not to drag this out in an outpatient clinic being uncomfortable for months only to just put off the withdrawal process anyway. BUT if tapering off subs even slowly is genuinely ""better"" than coming off methadone, I'm all for it.
I need out and I need to do something now. I've gotten to the point I can't stand the thought of when I next use, but im terrified of the physical wd (I can't take methadone atm as it stays in your system long in case I follow through with the subs appt after the weekend, so I want to make a decision ASAP..)  
Should I just stick with the 7 day methadone detox plan and push through a couple uncomfortable months to just get it over with. Or does anyone highly recommend a different method that didn't make you feel like death, even if it is the subs route..
I am open to any feedback. I would love to hear your experiences and which route worked for you?",12/21/24 7:28,

What would happen?,13,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hix12p/what_would_happen/,"What do you think would happen/how would it impact + or -'s
if you country regulated/legalized opiates for recreational use.
as a basic framework i am thinking in the way of; you are able to go to either your doc/pharmacy and be able to buy pharmaceuticals to use, the main one that comes to mind is Dilaudid because i am on safe supply in Canada and that is what i have been getting and i think that is the most basic/most versatile one to use, you can easily crush to snort or shoot with better harm reduction aspects too because of that.
And not being a free program but just like other intoxicants you have to buy them, and because its not the black market you aren't paying 20 dollars for 1 D8. but the standard pharmacy cost.
and with their still being a limitation on how much you can get/up to the discretion of the provider like booze stores/bars. And on that note maybe even having like Opiate bars/Opium dens where you can go in and use, but have to stay for a certain amount of time or something so your not super fucked up out in public. (don't know how this would work, just an idea)
I genuinely believe that opiates would have a massive therapeutical benefit on the general public compared to resorting to drinking booze as a release after work/self medicating. where obviously booze mentally intoxicates you and takes you out of your body/actions. not remembering what you did the night before, saying/doing things you normally wouldn't etc etc.
of course its addictive and their would be some problems associated with it, but just like how we allow certain leeway with the negative effects of alcohol on the public like at bars, fights, sexual assaults, drinking and driving etc etc, its a risk we know of and try to mitigate the issues.

and people mainly think that because its an opiate that all of a sudden we will have massive influx of junkies who will quit their jobs and become the cliche homeless welfare junky. which i think is a false narrative of things to come if it were to become legalized. Of course their will be problems for people, but that is the benefit of it no longer being hidden away but being public where you can get help from friends and family free of guilt and stigma jsut like happens when someone has a drinking problem you know/love.

Not to mention all of the benefits that would also come from the regulation such as:

\-Eliminating the Billions/trillions of dollar s in profit for Mexican cartels, middle eastern terrorist groups (isis, Al-Q), South east Asia tri-ads/gangs, South American Cartels.  
\-Saving the billions/trillions from unnecessary medical demands from overdoses, hospital visits/Ambulance calls, physical/mental harm from Toxic/tainted/unsafe for human consumption ingredients.  
\-With the profits from the sale of the narcotics it can be put back into social services to help reduce factors that lead addictive personalities/mentalities, better schooling, social housing, better health care funding, etc etc.  
\-Saving countless lives from ODs, life altering damages, and a healthier/safer population.  
\-by treating it as health crisis/medical concern and not criminalizing usage ***REDUCES*** criminal charges/records which hinders people from being able to get decent employment, community relationships, education, prospects for improving their lives out of the cycle of poverty/addiction. This is ***NOT*** to say that this gives addicts carte blanche to do anything/everything they want without consequences like we kind of see now. If you commit a crime/habitually commit crime even after having a safe/affordable supply the problem is above and beyond an addiction crisis it is deeper rooted that needs to be addressed/treated/removed from the community in a ethical/humane/proper way, not just jail/hospitals or death (na/aa words)  
\- Mental health improvements of society through using opiates as a recreational support compared to alcohol, and all of the physical, mental and emotional growth that can come from using an opiate as a unwinder to be able to become more introspectable and analytical of ourselves and those around us and be able to be high enough to not over react or have a emotional spontaneous reaction to a situation/circumstance like might happen with alcohol.

tapentadol is great! imo,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hhxzof/tapentadol_is_great_imo/,"here’s why i like tap …

1. tapentadol has a nice euphoria that you can build on if you want.
2. in my opinion, i get WAY less itching using tapentadol. some people like the ""itch,"" but i can't stand it.
3. THE COST! i switched to tapentadol because oxy was/is way too expensive. i heard people comparing 100 mgs of tapentadol to 20 mgs of oxy so i tried it out. $150 to $200 for 100 tapentadol tablets (100 mgs each)? COUNT ME IN!
4. safety... i haven't seen anyone (at least not yet) attempt to sell ""fake"" or pressed versions of tapentadol. it comes in pharmaceutical packaging too (blister packs).
5. all of my orders have made it to my place safely without any issues. secure packaging & never any trouble with customs.
6. tapentadol genuinely makes my mental & physical health so much better. i am able to go about my day & actually get things done (pain relief). i'm more productive & happier tbh.

tapentadol is a 10/10 if you're trying to have a good time on a budget. i’m thankful i have access to it. i couldn't leave my bed due to my physical pain (from my disabilities) & the depression that came along with that... i got my life back!",12/19/24 17:23,

Withdrawl question,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hi5dj3/withdrawl_question/,So to start off I have been taking pharma hydros(7.5mg) about 3-4 times a week for almost a year now with some small breaks here and there. My usual dose is around 30-40mg (CWE) when I want to nod and 20-30mg when I just want a buzz. Over time my tolerance hasnt seemed to go up much and I still feel them pretty good. I have taken 2-4 day breaks here and there and havent experienced really any WD symptoms aside from small cravings and boredom/moodiness. Are my doses/frequency too low to cause withdrawls? Or do you think if I took a longer break I'd experience more symptoms? Thanks for any input. Good luck to everyone out there🤙,12/19/24 22:47,

A few days ago I took about 1800mg of Tapentadol and 350mg or so of diphenhydramine (for the itchiness).

I remember taking more and more and not feeling any higher, but eventually I would find myself waking up after falling over in the kitchen after what I assumed to be passing out while standing up. Check the time and a couple hours have passed. It’s late so I go to sleep a little later and sleep well, but when I wake up I am super confused and believe I have missed a day, like waking up and having no idea how much time has passed.

Is this an OD? Is there a chance this could have killed me? I have a pretty decent opioid tolerance, but have not experienced this weird warping of time.

I don't and never have done opiates, but she was curious about them. She bought some H one day and she said it made her feel sick, so she wouldn't get anymore.

But she did buy more. She felt good this time. I felt sick. I felt sick because i was terrified my best friend would take something laced with worse drugs or she'd take too much or someone would hurt her.

I got myself two units of Naloxone for reversing overdoses long enough for the ambulance to arrive. I was trained how to use it. We got Nitazene testing strips to keep her safe from fentanyl. 

I couldn't look her in the eyes anymore. My best friend wasn't.. *there*, right now. She was a different person right now. We fought and argued because her usage was dragging me down too. I was using drugs more often and getting into trouble and i promised my SO I'd move out. 

I moved out. We stopped talking except for the occasional argument. She hadn't been online in several days and i was worried about her. I got a phone call from the police that day to tell me she'd passed away.

I found out a few days later it was apparently oxycodone that she'd tested for Nitazenes and then taken them anyway.

Pretty much I was on suboxone (4mg a day at the peak) since december of last year until october of this year. In April/may I started weaning myself off though by .5 mg every 2 weeks MAX. The last 2-3 months I was on .25-.5mg a day total which was a dose weak enough to me that I didnt feel any of the suboxone and had very little withdrawals symptoms from that point on.

I dont even have consistent access to pharma oxy anymore ive just had 6 10s laying around for when I felt like my tolerance had dropped low enough to enjoy them. Do you guys think if I take 2 each time I wanna take them (spread out 2-3 weeks per use) I wont get withdrawal symptoms? 

For context during the peak of my painkiller addiction I was doing 5+ 30mg oxys or 2-3 40mg opanas a day (snorting) for about 4 years. I have taken other extended tolerance breaks like this one in the past but have always only used suboxone for 2-3 weeks tops to get through withdrawals. This time I stayed on it for almost an entire year. Previous times I would say about after the 40-45 day mark I was able to take 20-30 mg of painkillers and be nodding. What do you guys think?

Also I am asking strictly for the physical withdrawal side, I am aware of how hard it can be mentally when getting back into an old drug.

Actually even though I don’t get that heavy high, I get that good feeling. I am positive, I am productive as opposed to the Oxy when I am just high and sleeping/nodding almost a day. 

I prefer Hydros, I can take 100mg of Hydro and feel great, but 200mg of Oxy? I barely feel it. 

When I take Tramadol I take 400mg in the morning with 1mg of Klonopin. I am good all day. I have this energetic happy feeling not a high. And for sleep I take 1mg of Klonopin and some Cyprexa 5mg. Wake up and repeat again.

When I stop the Tramadol for the Oxy yes it sucks. I feel all shakey, sick, and just gross. The first couple of days I can’t enjoy the Oxy high, because of the way I feel for stopping the Tramadol.

Again I only take the Tramadol to avoid WD’s. 

I have 105 pills left until refill the 14th for the Oxy. I will be talking to my doctor to put me on Hydrocodone and perhaps some Oxy for breakthrough pain. 

But, I plan to take 300mg of Tramadol for the next 10 days, so I won’t run out of Oxy. Because I genuinely feel good on Tramadol, not high just happy and positive. 

I am supposed to be on SSRI’s but I don’t take them. I also don’t want to take too much tram because of how shaky I get when I stop, since I buy these over the counter at a Mexican market here, I plan to taper the Trams. Give myself a tolly break. 

Am I weird for this? Again, I take 400mg of Tram a day with 1mg or 2 of Klonopin and another 1mg of Klonopin at night. But I plan to only take 300mg from now on and taper. I have my Oxy but I don’t want to run out especially since the Holidays are here and I don’t want to be sick around family.

COPD and insufflation ,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hgx7ea/copd_and_insufflation/,"Recently was diagnosed with most likely COPD - pending a couple things because I’m only 34 and never been a smoker. 

I’ve been snorting various drugs as a weekend warrior for about 8 years (1-4 nights a month) and opioids in the past 6 months, but not daily, more like 2-5 days a week. 

I know when snorted, traces of drugs can end up in the lungs (even if you aren’t snorting hard - and either way, no one’s perfect every time lol) — has anyone been diagnosed with COPD secondary to their drug use or known anyone to have had this? 

I’ve always kept drugs hush hush from my Drs (aside from a couple surgeries when I was honest with the anesthesia team), so I don’t think they’re thinking drugs could be a potential reason. 

Idk, is this even a common occurrence? 

I do have a connective tissue disorder that puts me at a higher risk for these things. 

I just wanted to ask other people before I spiral off the deep end or ask a Dr, ya know? But I will bring it up eventually, when I get the balls. 

Please be kind, I’m going through a lot with this potential disease. I watched it take my grandma, a great aunt, my grandpa died of a heart attack while living with lung cancer + COPD - but they were all smokers and it’s the reason I never smoked, no vaping, rarely even weed (maybe 3x a year). 😕 It’s scary out here sometimes, fam. 

🖤 


Edit to add : incase it’s confusing, I had testing done that points to COPD. I’m being sent to a second Pulmonologist for a second review (and I’m sure more testing) since I’m only 34 and never been a smoker. However, I do have a connective tissue disorder that essentially wrecks my body and puts me at a high risk for COPD and other things. Still strange nevertheless. ",12/18/24 8:22,
Tips for Psych Portion of Withdrawal ,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hgv97k/tips_for_psych_portion_of_withdrawal/,"Hey guys, I was put on Morphine XR everyday after a few years without methadone & constantly on opiates while I'm finishing my undergrad. I'm also on benzos usually twice a week, all script. I have insane BPD & cPTSD alot of rape & abuse shit as a child, seen too much pretty much the damage is too extent to not give benzos, opiates for the addiction & anti fentanyl protective measures.

I went from 60mg Morphine everyday to 30mg ON (OP) XR Oxy for a week, then 20, then 10, then 3-4 times a week, then less, slowly down to 60mg codeine few times a week is the goal.

After the week of 20mg I literally called in so quickly trying my hardest not to literally beg, he extended 20 for this week (till Friday) then 15, for a week, then 10, then I'm back in uni anyways so I'm chilling but, rn I haven't gone 24 hours without it since beginning of October, so I can't stop the freaking out screaming hurting myself breaking everything crying screaming sad rage and I can't cope and I'm gonna get pick up a dose of Xanax tomorrow but I'm so anxious for this shit like I can't possibly imagine going 24 hours without it rn...

What can I do for this? I've experienced withdrawals like so many times over the 8 years I've been a hard addict but, there's no way to prepare or avoid this part or else we all just wouldn't do it right... Any tips, cuz figuring out what a bullet tastes like seems better than this shit and I'm gonna lose my fucking mind, I'm so fucking weak and I've actually fully let my addiction consume me, I want better sometimes but I also don't wanna completely stop drugs ever, because I'm so mentally ill though not because of the highs, although it's definitely not something I'm complaining about but, I haven't even tried to get sober in 5 years, went to rehab to get off ketamine and it worked but even that I didn't wanna get off opiates and benzos and I told them that",12/18/24 6:01,

I thought of making a post before taking some, as if someone here would advise me not to, but I ended up convincing myself I would rather talk about how easy it is to go back to my shit-formed pleasure seeking hell of a decision making machine i’ve got attached to my neck. 

I guess all there is to do is enjoy, the one thing I will no longer be able to do for a few months. 

hope you’re reaching cero tolerance and/or absolute sobriety. Life it’s more memorable, less lonely and much more fulfilling that what opiates have to offer, we just haven’t had the best inputs. 

although having that opium experience input I deeply believe will make my life better in the long term, if I manage to quit. All there is to know and the newest self consciousness to explore, I look forward to that.

Up until about 6 months ago I was entirely opiate naive.

I've gotten my drugs from the 🧅, and have tested every substance at a nearby testing facility to confirm that they are legit. 

I started with codeine, and when it didn't do anything I assumed that they weren't strong enough, or that I possess the gene/lack the enzyme that prevents them from metabolizing.

After that, I tried hydrocodone, which again didn't work at all, even with pretty substantial doses.

Hey everyone,

I have a weird question that I have been trying to figure out for some time with no luck.  Maybe you guys know of this or have experienced it.
So I am a recreational oxycodone user.  As in, I have a friend that has a prescription and she will give me like 10, 10mg pills like once a month or every other month so I am not a daily user. Anyway for about 4 years now when I take a higher dose…80 to 100mg I get this very strange suckling of my tongue when I sleep.  My tongue gets in this weird position in my mouth and I just kind of suckles and that is almost the only word I can use to describe it.  It almost sounds like a dog licking his balls lol.  If it is bad enough sometimes it wakes my wife up and if I am doing it hard enough it wakes me up too.  I am very aware that my tongue feels different but not swollen or anything like that.  When I am not on opiates I can NOT get my tongue in the suckle position and replicate the sound and feeling.  This ONLY happen when I take opiates and it has also happened a few times on higher doses of Kratom.  It is a very distinct feeling and always stops as I come down from the medicine.
Please tell me somebody has experienced this or know of anyone that has.  I want to know what it is about opiates that triggers this and if it possibly is a documented thing.

Protonitazene,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hfws7l/protonitazene/,"Hello! I have been a fentanyl user on and off since 2018. I got a bit over a year sober at one point, then had 3-8 month periods of use scattered throughout that time, about 2 or 3 times. My current run has been ongoing for about 15 months of daily usage. I use anywhere between 2g-5g+ a day (honestly, I could go more than that if I pleased... but I am always as safe as I can be... at least as safe as you can be when using fentanyl, as I’ve only OD’d once, and that was my very first use of rock product. On top of it being my first time using ""raw,"" I was also 6 months sober at the time, so my tolerance was basically non-existent. Prior to this, I had only used dirty 30s). I smoke it off foil and dab it as well. I am in the Los Angeles area, so I know dope has taken a turn for the worse when it comes to purity. It’s basically impossible to find good dope, or anything that resembles 2019-2021 dope. I’ve found a guy who has what I find to be the closest thing to it, and I find it potent and enjoyable, but due to him being damn near the only person who has good shit (and in an area that is an open-air drug market with a plethora of dope, dealers, and users to compete with, backing up my claims), I’m also paying a good bit extra for the quality (I usually get 6-7 grams for $300 USD).

On to the point of the post, though. I have recently found a vendor online who has Protonitazene at fairly good prices, and it’s said to be pretty damn pure. I am aware that this shit is extremely lethal and dangerous, that it’s more potent than fentanyl by 2x or more, and could kill someone using it whether they’re being reckless or not. I am not here to have anyone talk me out of buying it (though I’m still willing to listen to any war stories or experiences you may have heard or had with the substance... but this is not the main reason I’ve made this post). I was curious about others' experiences with the substance, how they dosed it according to their existing tolerance to opiates. I was also curious about people’s opinions on the high, and anything else you might think of when it comes to the substance.

Again, please don't comment just trying to talk me out of it. If you have a story or experience to go along with your “don’t do it, you’ll die” comment, that’s okay... but again, I am not trying to just get dry comments talking me out of it without personal experiences with the substance (whether it be by you or someone close to you). Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope I don’t come off as an asshole or pretentious. I am just curious about the drug and want to know more so I can be safe and make my OWN decision on whether or not I am going to order it. To me, I’ve heard people who use as much fentanyl as I do have dosed at 2 AM and not needed/thought about dosing again until 10-11 PM that night. That would save a ton of money... Plus, I’ve read it was the best experience they’ve had with opiates altogether, with the best high. It sounds like a win-win situation to me (other than the danger aspect, but remember, I’m a veteran opiate user and already on a very high usage of fentanyl right now, and have been for a while).",12/16/24 23:26,

Rehab,6,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hfw9yy/rehab/,This is my first post on Reddit and with this community. I had nearly a year clean off opiates (6 days before my 1 year) until my life in sobriety became too much. I gave up and used again and I have been ever since. I started using when I was 17 and I’m 25 now. I’ve been repeating this cycle over and over and over again. All my money is gone that I’ve saved up. Im waking up sick and feeling like shit everyday. I’m in so much debt. I’m barely keeping it together around my family. It’s the holiday season and the last thing they need is to find out that I relapsed again and I’m back in rehab. Idk what to do. I’ve been to rehab 5 different times. Should I just go as long as I can or go back to rehab. I can’t believe this has happened again. I just need some help and suggestions on what I should do. I’ve fucked myself again.,12/16/24 23:03,

SR-17018 is a miracle drug for recovery. Down from 600mg of isotonitazene a day to nothing in just three weeks with virtually no withdrawal,28,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hfoenq/sr17018_is_a_miracle_drug_for_recovery_down_from/,"This is a miracle drug. If you have such a high tolerance like me the first 3-4 days you will still experience very minor withdrawals (just anxiety, trouble sleeping, etc - zero peripheral withdrawals), but after that they disappear.

~7 days on 80mg twice a day, then down to 80mg once a day for another two weeks.

One thing I have noticed that's weird is it often takes 4 hours to kick in. Almost extremely reliably it would wear off after 12.5 hours (nearly every time). I also cannot for the life of me figure out how eating impacts it, it just seems random to me (with the exception of an entirely empty stomach -that's the worst way it works, I'd say taking it then eating might be the best, but that might be some sort of bias.

Make sure not to take too much or too little. 70-90mg seems to be the working range for me.

Does it stop cravings? Sort of. It lessens them, but they tend to show up around 7.5 hours for me (for maybe 2 hours).

Also I highly recommend NOT storing it in the freezer like others suggest. At least in a current UK-like climate. I did and it absorbed a bunch of water (I tried to seal it, but evidently even a small crack allowed it to do this), and I was seriously concerned I had damaged it. The worries about it having a short half life under ambient conditions do not seem founded to me. And also remember that if you ordered it from a certain country, it has been travelling for weeks and was fine (and likely was not stored under cool conditions in that country).",12/16/24 17:30,
Switching opiates - Oxy to Fentanyl patches ?,1,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hfnjv3/switching_opiates_oxy_to_fentanyl_patches/,"Hey fellow Bropiates..

First things first: I am prescribed 160mg of OxyGesic a day due to medical problems i don't want to spread out here. 
I take other Drugs as well and was slowly adjusted to my actual combination of drugs / dosage during a longer hospital stay.

Now to my actual situation:
Its clear for all specialists i have been to that i will never be pain free again. Took a long time to accept but here i am.
My Doctor and me are pretty sure taking even more Oxy won't have any benefits but only more side effects.

My Doc says the next usefull thing we could maybe do is a stationary ""opioid rotation"" and switch to another drug like Hydromorphone, Morphine or Fentanyl (patches).
This would include a stay for a few days in a ""pain clinic"" and i have no idea if i will get a choice wich drug to try or not. That and the very bad last hospital stay.. well..i just don't want to go stationary again and maybe get treated like a child or an addict. In fact i have build up a fucking fear over a hospital stay at this point.

Sorry for venting at this point..

Would switching from OxyGesic to Fentanyl patches be worth a try ?
Did somebody here did this change and can give me some insights ?
Were you able to switch back or did your Doc wanted you to stay on the new drug ?

Did you profit from switching or did they put you on a lower equivalent dose and your pain went up ? (my big fear at the moment...to have more pain after switching then now)


I think switching to Fentanyl patches would be the ""go to"" way and most likely because its mostly used for long (long) time opioid users.

So..any of your experiences would be greatly appreciated...",12/16/24 16:54,

Not soma

But 2 Dilaudid 8mg!!!!! It was a decent price for those IMO. I had to sit & think for a long ass minute😂 literally I had always regretted one thing only, that I'd never felt the incredible rush of Dilaudid, I'd only ever had it before my IV days. I always said if I could try IV Dilaudid Id do it even if I had long-term recovery. 

But of course, not only do I have 3 people who I absolutely CANNOT let down even for a second, but my Suboxone would make it almost impossible to feel, it'd be a waste of money, time, needles & veins lmao.

Nitazenes in (Central) Europe,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hfjqvp/nitazenes_in_central_europe/,"Sup guys, I'm looking for more accounts and experiences with street dope in the last months/year or two, it seems like dope is coming back after the drought of last year or so, but since then it's always been weird.

At first it had a very weird smell and taste, super harsh and burned black on foil, the dope was hard as a rock with black spots, it's like they totally changed product and cuts.

Now dope that looks decent is making a comeback, but I can tell something is still off.
Color and texture seem the same, it slides well on foil, but it still has a particular smell and taste, not the classic vinegary one from good H.

The most telling sign tho is how caustic it is, since a year or two almost all the dope I've seen around is extremely caustic, burns like fuck if snorted and you can even feel it when smoking, smoking it gave me heartburn and acid reflux so bad that I literally wouldn't use it because it just made me feel sick. 

Never had that happen with real good #3 and it never felt that bad to snort, i remember not feeling a thing when doing lines of H and getting that nice smell and taste, now i almost can't even do a line 

At first it was also trash and you'd need grams to get an high, now all of a sudden a .3 smoked on foil got me nodding.

The nodding and high is weird too tho, doesn't feel as dreamy and warm, and short lived, it's more like i blacked out for an hour or two than actual nodding.

I'm almost sure they are starting to cut zenes into the classic #3 dope, probably a mix of low telescope from the afghan ban and crazy profit margins with sinteric opioids.

I'm wondering if anyone has had the same or has any info/data about it (like drug testing data or studies), if so let me know how prevalent it wascompared to good H, and if possible mention the whereabouts of where you're from, it doesn't go against the subs rules it's just to get a general idea.

I haven't been copping since a while and I genuinely stopped craving street H because of that, I'm thankfully prescribed a decent dose of morphine so I've just switched to that instead and try to keep my daily dose low to nod once a week or so.

Fighting cravings? My therapist just gave me a cool tool to use....,43,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hempzw/fighting_cravings_my_therapist_just_gave_me_a/,"My therapist recently flipped the way I think about cravings, and it’s made a huge difference. I’d been telling him how much I was fighting my cravings for my drug of choice, and he gave me a completely different perspective:

**""Don't fight your craving...welcome them to your dinner party, give them a VIP seat, they aren't your enemy...don't be rude.""**

Here’s the analogy he shared: Picture your craving as if it was someone stopping by your house uninvited. Instead of slamming the door in their face or arguing with them, you say, “Come on in, take a seat. Tell me what’s on your mind.” You acknowledge their presence, hear them out, ask if they want coffee, they have every right to be heard. Then politely let them know you have other plans but appreciate them stopping by and let them know they're always welcome back, anytime.""

It sounds strange, but this kills the anxiety that normally comes with my cravings. Because I try to shake them...but they KEEP coming back stronger....and stronger...until...I sometimes use. But now I don't fight them, or even try to shake them....welcome in homie, I just made coffee! You like cream or sugar or black?

The craving didn’t disappear instantly, but it didn’t feel overwhelming anymore. The anxiety eased, and I could actually move on without feeling like I was in a full-blown battle.

So, next time you’re dealing with a craving, try this: Picture it as an unexpected guest. Let it pull up a chair, hear it out, and calmly remind yourself you’re not buying what it’s selling. The more you practice this, the more those cravings lose their grip.

Hope this helps someone out there struggling—you’re stronger than you think. Stay kind to yourself!",12/15/24 6:27,

In an in-vitro assay (guinea pig ileum preparation), 7-hydroxymitragynine had a 13 and 46-fold higher potency than morphine and mitragynine (Takayama et al., 2002).*

Withdrawing off 40mg oxy ,2,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1heg8q0/withdrawing_off_40mg_oxy/,"So through the end of November, around the last 2 weeks, I decided to take on an opiate addiction. Really I’ve had this going for a second, but the withdrawal was only mental never physical. So anyway, I did 40mg for about 2 weeks and my last day did 80mg. The 80mg dosage sent me in extreme physical withdrawal after it wore off. I’m 48 hours in, how long will this last? Is there anything I can take that’ll help? When will the physical symptoms let up?

Symptoms are basically that of the flu
* Extreme hot and cold sweats
* Achy muscle pains
* first day I had a bunch of occasional diarrhea 

I’m not too concerned on the mental aspect as I’ve been dealing with addiction problems for a few years now. Although, the anxiety is extreme.

First time did Tramadol XR,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hdwyls/first_time_did_tramadol_xr/,"So for the better understanding I will give you my whole therapy which I take through the day:

sertraline 150mg
lamotrigine 125mg
alprazolam 1mg
clonazepam 0,5mg

And today I was prescribed to opiate called Tramadol XR 50mg due to my nerve pain from my back through knee and finally pain hits in tongue.

Was prescribed with this strong drug bc ibuprofen, naproxen did not helped.

So I had deal with friends about going out and drink. I do not drink usually, maybe twice a month. But I never does alcohol on daily base.

Today in the morning I took sertraline and lamotrigine.

afternoon took 1mg of alprazolam, 5mg of diazepam, somewhere around 6PM.

And ofc, I started overanalyzing interactions, between all this stuff.

Usually reviews, research paper and drugs interaction was like this.
1. Tramadol and sertraline can cause serotonin syndrome.
2. Alcohol and benzos are both depressors.
3. Tramadol and alcohol major interaxtion side effects.

So, after all study. I took around 8PM 125mg of tramadol xr,
waited two hours nothing happened. Then I realised that crushing xr tramadol can act faster. So I took more 225  mixed with water.

Started feeling more calm and experience bit of stimulation around 00:00., I was drinking vodka with tangerine x3 and one beer. But I was drinking slowly. 

Then about 3 AM I felt calm, relaxed, and mid stimulated, and little dissociated.

Then went home at 6AM and felt benefits like this:
1. mid high
2. mid euphoria
3. quite stimulated
4. relaxed

And now at home I will go to sleep, but I feel more stimulated then 4-5 h ago. But also feelin sedation and dissociation, which gives me relief.

So, my plan for next time is to take smaller dose 175mg but crushed it and mixed it with water. And that means I will take half as much (175mg), and get benefits in 3-4h.

I will take this 2-3x in one month.

Music helped me throw it away,7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hdg55w/music_helped_me_throw_it_away/,"A few months ago I went through a really stressful time at work, wasn’t sure if I was going to make it. So ofc I picked up some shit. And while it helped me after work to help me calm down and set it aside, the next day I was immediately in hell on top of the soul crushing stress of my responsibilities at work. It wasn’t helping me. But I kept using that shit after work to “help me” 

One day I woke up and was just so exhausted from the cycle of it all. I prayed to god that if he could provide even just some relief from this madness, I’d just throw it all out, and that would be the end of it. 

That first day I was puking out my guts, walking to work in the freezing wind on top of already being extremely cold and exhausted. Just randomly I was playing “Mrs Robinson” covered by the lemonheads. I just had it on repeat. I made the connection of my praying to god and all the versus of Jesus the song had. The song made me think of a music video of me comming clean to my gf, detoxing somewhere ect. Kindof cliche I know. But the music helped ground myself a bit. It’s not even that great of a song. Ended up finding a garbage can at a bus stop, tossed in my stash with minor second thoughts and kept walking. 

“Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes, 
Hide it in your pantry with your cupcakes, 
It’s a little secret just the Robinsons affair, 
Most of all you’ve got to hide it from the kids kookookachoo, 
Mrs Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know, woah woah woah” 

And the phrases 
“Laugh about it shout about it when you’ve got to choose
Every way you look at it you lose” 

Every time I get the itch I think back to that day, and what I was going through on the days leading up to it. And it helps me remember it’s not worth it. At least for what’s readily available. It’s garbage. And it makes you feel like garbage.

Tapentadol: the opioid with the most tolerable/minimal withdrawals ,5,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hdevm8/tapentadol_the_opioid_with_the_most/,"This is a discussion post; I'm doing it to see what other people's experiences or opinions are. 

So I got a bunch of 100 mg tapentadol (Aspadol brand) recently. Definitely real pharma, came in blister packs, plus the feeling was identical to the ones I get from my doc.

I took them every day for about 7 weeks. My dosage was between 200 - 350 mg each day. I finished my supply about 3 days ago. I was expecting a pretty uncomfortable withdrawal, nothing compared to Oxy or other heavier opiates, but I thought it'd be pretty bad.

But it wasn't. I had a bit of the expected body aches, headache, and I was sneezing a bit, but that's all. I have, and did use, comfort meds including Vyvanse and Dex,
so they made it way easier, but my question or point is - WTF? It should have been much worse? Shouldn't it?

"If drugs are the solution, then what is the problem?",16,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hdciz9/if_drugs_are_the_solution_then_what_is_the_problem/,"A common saying in the recovery community is something to the effect of ""drugs weren't my problem, they were my solution.""

I feel that this was true for me. In fact, I made a list of the problems I had, in the general order in which they came up, and for which drugs were my solution - even if this ""solution"" inevitably created more problems. 

My problems came in three stages: early, middle, and end-stage addiction. I found this to be a useful exercise for reflection and recommend you try it. Feel free to add your thoughts to the comments if nowhere else👇 

EARLY ADDICTION: EXPERIMENTATION AND SNIFFING OXY

ANXIETY: being struck with sudden and overwhelming self-awareness at 14 led to a strong sense of anxiety. Self-medicating with opioids made this discomfort fade away. After sniffing some oxy, I could crack jokes with zero inhibition, and not a care in the world what you thought about me either way. Anxiety was my initial problem, and opioids were a bonafide solution.

LOW SELF-ESTEEM: I was a people pleaser from the rip; this was my second big problem. I always loved making people laugh and impressing people when I was younger. I worried about what other people thought about me and didn't ever think about what I thought about myself. 

Low self-esteem was fertile ground for the roots of addiction and opioids were an ultra-potent fertilizer, since they gave me a positive feeling about myself that I wasn't achieving elsewhere. They made me feel powerful. This quickly led to another problem: my self-esteem would slip away when I wasn't high. The vicious cycle begins.

WOMEN: This must be mentioned early on in this list. One of my favorite things about opioids initially was the feeling that they gave me around women. Ultra-confident, silver-tongued, carefree, and with the ability to please her for longer than two minutes (lol). Opioids gave me a feeling of emotional invincibility. They quickly became a necessity for any social event with women present, and absolutely mandatory for any date type situation.

LACK OF IDENTITY: adolescence is a crucial time in which humans naturally specialize into a field, historically speaking. Gone are the days of the adolescent son rubbing shoulders with his master blacksmith father and learning what it means to be a blacksmith. I had no mentorship or apprenticeship experience of any sort - I doubt many teenagers do these days, especially those that wind up addicted.

My lack of an intrinsic sense of identity and external specialization led me to quickly adopt the identity of psychonaut and drug user, which eventually led to the identites of drug dealer, drug educator, street pharmacist, and eventually ""addict"" (a label i no longer identify with)

IDLE TIME: I played sports when I was younger and was athletic but quit several sports and didn't push myself hard. My parents let me quit and didn't push me either. I'm not blaming them, just mentioning it as I believe this ""idle time"" was indeed the devil's workshop for me. 

I see kids these days involved in extracurriculars and can't help but wonder what my life could've been like if I had more structure and accountability. Instead of going to practice after school, I would get high with my buddies once high school ended and immediately become ultra-focused on the hustle and bustle of the drug game.

IMPAIRED SALIENCE BASED ATTENTION SYSTEM AKA ADHD: High school did not hold my attention. The idea of going to college and earning a degree wasn't salient / attention-grabbing to me. I wanted a lot of money and power, fast, and the drug game offered the risks and excitement regular life couldn't hold a candle to. 

I was prescribed adderall for ADHD when I was younger but didn't like that it actually caused me to sit still and pay attention. Other kids would literally ask me what was wrong with me when I took it, so I stopped. My life would likely look very different had I just stayed on it and allowed myself to become a cog in the educational machine.

GREED: Greed is defined as ""having or showing an intense and selfish desire for something, especially wealth or power."" This describes exactly how i felt when i was younger, and it was obviously a huge problem. The strange combination of greed and low self-esteem can be a real killer. My value of self was determined by my ability to attain things, and on top of that, I truly and deeply desired wealth and power.

SELFISHNESS: There is certainly such a thing as healthy selfishness, and unhealthy selflessness, but when I was in early addiction I was selfish to a fault. I felt that I was entitled to pleasure, status, and wealth. Thinking about it now makes me cringe.

MIDDLE PHASE OF ADDICTION: ENTER HEROIN

There were problems I had before I picked up that led to me becoming an ""addict"". Being an ""addict"", however, also created a whole host of other problems - ironically and terribly, drugs were the solution for many of these problems as well.

CHRONIC STRESS: using and selling drugs was incredibly stressful for me. There was the stress of the drug game - people trying to rob me, running around doing illegal shit, trying to avoid getting caught using by my family - and the incredible stress of the criminal justice system, in my case. 

I was arrested 4 times between the ages of 14 and 18, and had a 3 year suspended prison sentence hanging over my head while doing intensive outpatient and pissing multiple times a week for probation entering my adulthood. The stress was incredible. I could barely sleep. I had recurring dreams of having to fight in prison. Oxy - and then dope - helped it all fade away, if only for a blink and a nod.

This chronic stress might look totally different for someone else. Physical pain can be a big chronic stressor. Accumulated debts are another. Work and familial responsibilities have the potential to be unbelievably stress-inducing. A very common comorbidity with addictive disorders is PTSD. The trauma response results in elevated stress hormones aka chronic stress.

DEPRESSION: Chronic stress directly causes depression; the medical literature is clear about that. When I was addicted and trying to quit, the depression was incredible. 

Why get out of bed? What do I have to look forward to? Why fight? The lack of energy was palpable. I could barely will myself to breathe sober breaths. Simply smiling was a momentous task.

NEGATIVE SELF-IMAGE: In the middle stage of addiction, I started to make some attempts to stop doing drugs. I couldn't. I felt like a fucking loser. I was a piece of shit. People told me I would be an ""addict"" for the rest of my life. People were watching me constantly, waiting for me to fuck up again, and I hated it all.

At a certain point, i felt like i might as well act like who i felt I was, and behave in accordance with what people were telling me that I was. One of the reasons I continued to use drugs was because I - and everyone around me - held the image of me as a person who uses drugs. I was going to be an ""addict"" forever, so why try to be anything else? This is a subtle, almost subconscious mental process that led me to unbelievable suffering and continuous relapse.

COMPULSIVENESS: I was likely predisposed to compulsiveness before I started getting high, but drugs made me unbelievably compulsive. I would smoke weed automatically if it were around me, even knowing that I didn't really like it or that it was going to make me anxious or that I could go to prison if i were caught. Opioids gave me a feeling of freedom from the compulsiveness, even if my behavior didn't change. I just felt like things were a little slower and that I was more in control, I suppose.

OBSESSIVENESS: My thoughts became obsessive, to the point that I felt like I was going crazy. I would obsess over not doing drugs and then obsess over doing drugs in the very next moment. I felt no freedom of thought, my thoughts were automatic and cyclical in a way that would make me want to scream. Of course, the dope would quiet my mind - until it didn't (see end-stage addiction)

BOREDOM: On days that i conquered the stress, depression, negative feelings of self, and drug-induced OCD, I would be confronted with an incredible boredom. Even smoking weed, eating chocolate cake, and playing halo 3 - which would have been heaven to me just a few years earlier - wouldn't satisfy me; and it would often just leave me burnt out and tired and feeling like even more of a loser. Boredom was one of a cluster of related problems, and they shared the same inevitable, predictable, sole solution: dope.

LONELINESS: Boredom would be compounded by loneliness, and I knew that one of my homies was only a phone call away. I could call him, go pick him up, and then go get any number of substances, and ride around selling them and getting high and meeting all kinds of different people. To go from the loneliness and boredom to that social chaos on top of the high was nearly irresistable to me, especially as a person that had ADHD and drug-induced OCD.

SENSATION SEEKING: this deserves to be on here because it is a real problem for many people trying to develop out of an addiction. I had to be able to accurately frame the ""chaos"" and ""fun"" of the drug game and see it for what it really is: an illusion. In reality, drug use is a monotonous treadmill of pain, loss, and perpetual dissatisfaction that exists on the edge of an eroding cliff.

END-STAGE ADDICTION: IV SPEEDBALLS AND XANAX

LIFE: By the time I reached 12 years of addiction at age 26, I was just done with life. Being alive and conscious was the problem. My addiction crystallized and became all of me. 

Lack of identity in the early stage had become a permanent and all-consuming Identity: I was nothing but a no-good addict, who was capable only of getting everyone's hopes up through stints of recovery, only to wind up worse than ever.

My low self esteem (stage 1), which had evolved into negative self-image (stage 2) had become an incredible and aggressive self-loathing. Quieting the mind with drugs was completely impossible. I started to feel genuine rage: towards God, myself, and everyone around me. I started to understand the darkest elements of human nature.

Loneliness, sensation seeking, boredom, - none of these problems could even be conceived as separate any longer. My problem was that I was alive, and had to continue to experience the hell of end-stage hardcore drug addiction, which had become my only reality. Hope had become the illusion; sobriety could never be achieved. I started to doubt that even death could save me; I would go from one hell to another.

The only thing that kept me alive at the end was the knowledge that if I killed myself with this injection, then I wouldn't be able to get that infamous ""one more"", no matter how unsatisfying it always was. My last two weeks of hardcore addiction consisted of using solely to obliterate consciousness. I could not stand to be awake.

End stage addiction was like being ensnared in a vast and intricate spider web of problems. Everywhere I turned I saw problems that were linked in a million unsolvable ways.

The solutions that were immediately apparent were to numb myself to the web of problems with the most potent drugs known to man, which doesn't even work at the end stage anyway, or obliterate myself and the web, which I was very close to doing.

Luckily, my family came to help me one last time. Apparently I reached out to them during a blackout. I could not have escaped the web by myself.

All of life had become one problem, which meant there was only one solution: transformation. I think this is why spirituality is the most successful treatment for addiction. It leads to transformation. 

Transformation is akin to a process of controlled and subtle self-immolation that extends outward into the web of problems that surrounds me. The web becomes weaker; I am able to navigate it with more control.

That was my experience, anyway, and transformation is a topic that deserves its' own post.

"FAQ: SR-17018, a potential miracle drug for those who wish to quit opioids",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hcmb4b/faq_sr17018_a_potential_miracle_drug_for_those/,"(Cross-posting this from another sub for increased visibility!)

Hi guys! 

I’ve noticed that searching for information on SR-17018 is really difficult. All of the experience reports are spread out and hard to find, and posts frequently get deleted as time goes on. I figured I was not the only one having the same problem finding reliable information on SR-17018. 

I’m extremely excited to announce that I’ve finally finished putting together my [SR-17018 Masterdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ibgxFT9z9bHqQn7HftNGfOxfiBDyU1fK0QMWSfLkvSM/edit?usp=sharing). It contains all of the experience reports I could find on Reddit about SR-17018. I used the information I learned along with my own personal experience using SR-17018 to quit kratom to create an automated taper schedule generator on Google Sheets as well. Links to both will be at the bottom of this post, and they will be updated frequently as more information comes out and more people post about this miracle substance. 

For those of you who don’t have the time to look through the whole Google doc, I’m going to put an FAQ below. 


*Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional, and the information provided herein should not be construed as medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider before making any decisions related to your health or treatment. The content provided is for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for professional medical advice.*


SR-17018 is a biased G-protein mu-opioid receptor agonist. This means that when it binds to the mu-opioid receptor, it has a strong preference for G-protein signaling rather than beta-arrestin signaling. Researchers haven’t quite figured out the mechanism for why this happens just yet, but for some reason, taking SR-17018 can both **stop opioid withdrawal symptoms** and **reverse tolerance to opioids**. And because of its bias *away* from beta-arrestin, it has **minimal respiratory depression** compared to something like morphine or fentanyl. 

So, basically: if you have been trying to get off of opioids to no avail, SR-17018 *may* help you quit.


Sorry, but I can’t help you with that. If you do end up finding some, please be extremely cautious as it may not be legitimate. 


SR-17018 is insoluble in water and PG, meaning that you have to take it **orally**. It is soluble in 10:10:80 DMSO/Tween-80 (polysorbate 80)/water, so if you really want to, you can make a solution for oral dosing with that. But you cannot snort, boof, or shoot it. 


**No.** Although it has an impressive ability to attenuate opioid withdrawal symptoms, SR-17018 has not been reported to have any recreational effects, and does not produce euphoria. 


The jury is still out on this one. Some people report SR-17018 helping with withdrawals, but most of the reports I’ve seen have said that it does **not** have analgesic effects. It *may* help opioid-naive people with pain management, but personally, I experienced a pretty sharp increase in my chronic pain when I switched to it from my 300 mg/day mitragynine habit. 


Yes, although if you are doing this, you must exercise **extreme caution**. At least one person has reportedly **died** from an overdose after reducing their tolerance to opioids using SR-17018. 


**Nobody can answer this question yet.** It doesn’t seem to induce respiratory depression at doses below 150 mg. It also appears to be relatively harmless to mice according to available scientific literature. But nobody will know the long-term effects of SR-17018 on humans for a long time. I personally tolerate it very well and have not noticed any negative side effects while taking it. But I think that it’s *very* important that you only take enough to keep withdrawals at bay and that you stay on the drug for as short of a period as possible: the truth is that nobody knows how it could be affecting our bodies and brains, especially long-term.


As of December 12, 2024, **SR-17018 is legal** for research purposes. It is not legal for human consumption, but in my opinion, unless you are buying hundreds of grams of the stuff or getting caught with mystery white powder in your car when you get pulled over, you are not likely to be at risk of legal trouble for ordering it. 


When transitioning to SR-17018 from another opioid, there are two main approaches that have been reported on Reddit. **Both have been shown to work**, so it’s up to you.

* **Immediate Transition:** Discontinuing the current opioid and initiating SR-17018 immediately. Pros of this approach: 
   * It’s safer (you will not have to continually guess where your tolerance is at and will not risk taking too much of your DOC as your tolerance reduces).
   * It’s faster.
   * You will use less SR-17018 overall, which may be an advantage if you are strapped for cash or not able to get SR-17018 consistently.
   * You do not have to rely on willpower to taper down on your drug of choice. When you quit it, you can be done with making that decision. 
* **Gradual Transition:** Tapering the dosage of the current opioid down while taking SR-17018 to mitigate withdrawals, then switching to it when your DOC dosage is low enough. SR-17018 does not cause precipitated withdrawals, so it is completely possible to use it concurrently with your opioid of choice to more gradually reduce tolerance before jumping off completely. Pros of this approach: 
   * You will likely experience less withdrawal symptoms compared to the immediate transition approach. 


Reports from Reddit say that **SR-17018 lasts anywhere from 6-12 hours**, with most people saying it lasts around eight hours. In my experience, it takes about 30 minutes after a dose to start noticing improvements in withdrawal symptoms. These improvements peak about 2 hours after dosing and this peak lasts for 5-6 hours (7-8 hours total). After the peak, the effects wane off over the course of 1-2 hours. Because of this effects timeline, **one dose every eight hours** works the best for me. 


I’ve seen reports of success with starting doses **anywhere from 25 mg to 150 mg**. Your exact dosage is going to be dependent on a lot of factors: how much you weigh, how quickly you metabolize SR-17018, and your current opioid consumption will all influence this answer. As an example, someone who had been taking kratom reported needing 150 mg doses every eight hours to get relief, while someone else switching to SR-17018 from zenes said 50 mg every twelve hours was enough. **The best way to figure out how much you should take is experimentation.** I explain how to (more) safely experiment with SR-17018 dosages in-depth in my taper guide. 

Additionally, it is not known what the morphine milligram equivalent (MME) conversion factor of SR-17018 in humans is. In rats, 1 mg of SR-17018 is equivalent to 1 mg of morphine. In my experience, however, this does not translate very well. **The potency of SR-17018 does not seem to increase linearly with dosage**: the difference in effects between 10 mg and 25 mg is larger than the difference between 25 and 40, which is larger than the difference between 40 and 55. I’d say the benefits hit a quasi-ceiling effect at around 100 mg per dose: anything above 100 mg will not really be all that much better at helping with withdrawals than just taking 100 mg. 

Another important thing to mention is that smaller, more frequent doses are likely going to be much better at managing withdrawal symptoms than larger, less frequent doses. At the beginning of my switch over to SR-17018 from 300 mg mitragynine daily, after my allergy test, I took **25 mg every two hours until my withdrawals were manageable**. I figured out over the course of about 32 hours with a lot of experimenting (and religious dose logging!) that 65 mg every eight hours is my optimal dose. I would not recommend taking SR-17018 more frequently than every two hours because of how long it takes to fully kick in. You don’t want to accidentally overdo it.

7OH Simulation,6,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hcffvw/7oh_simulation/,"Hi
It’s been a while. I’ve been well out of the game since 2017, off subs since 2020. I never looked back. 

Sometimes I truly feel like I’m living in a simulation. I believe I’ve failed a litmus test designed specifically for me. After cutting off ties with dealers for good years ago and being so far out of the game, I figured I was set for life to be free from temptation. I never would’ve imagined an extracted partial agonist would be so easily accessible OTC (at least in my state). 7OH meets the hype…in a bad way. It’s not AMAZING but it gets the job done. Regardless, you pay in WDs the same as more decent opiates, even after short-term use. 

Maybe this is the wrong sub since dope isn’t really heroin anymore. But man, if something like this existed during my active use things could’ve been different. Maybe I would’ve just scratched that itch without escalating to IV heroin. 

Anyways, I got a little carried away with 7OH but it’s only been a few weeks. I’m taking steps to comfortably get off as quickly as possible. I would’ve laughed at a post like this while using H and then getting off subs. But the 7OH WDs are certainly “triggering” for lack of a non-cringe word. Though I’m optimistic that I’m seasoned enough to handle it. 

I simply don’t have the time or energy to go through the whole cycle again. And not with Suboxone this time, even a rapid taper would jeopardize continuing other medications I’m prescribed. I got the chance to rebuild my life and used it. I need to quit this quietly, move on and never forget in case I face another seemingly impossible scenario in the future. Perhaps morphine analogues will be offered at restaurants like wine in 2034. 

I don’t know what my point is. Accountability? Perhaps a message to always quit while you’re ahead. We’re all stronger than we think. ",12/12/24 6:57,

Taking Opioid Pain Pills Are JUST As Dangerous As Heroin. Here’s Why. Hydrocodone/Oxycodone & the Tricks the Human Mind Can Play. A Paper On This Topic & My Story. ,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hc68kh/taking_opioid_pain_pills_are_just_as_dangerous_as/,"We can all agree that no human usually should or typically will start their addiction to opioids by starting with heroin. Most of the time they will not live to see the next day if that was the case. We can also come to agreement that most of us reach the point of severe opioid dependence (heroin, fentanyl, etc.) due to the inevitable outcome that arrives with using pharmaceutical opioid painkiller pills such as hydrocodone or oxycodone, the most common. 

Let’s get to the point though. In short, my argument is that common pharmaceutical pain pills like hydrocodone are so commonly prescribed for slightly minor surgeries/short periods of recovery such as a simple tooth extraction for a 15 year old (me as example). The notion that they are so commonly prescribed by doctors for pain along with that specific drug being arguably the most weakest form of opioid painkiller, leads people (including the user) to believe that this medication is the least harmful therefore OK to take at a longer duration of time or higher dose. This simple illusion created by the mind leads to the personal belief that it is OK or more OK to take the “least harmful” form of this drug & that it is OK to keep taking the drug for a longer period of time simply because it is the most commonly prescribed, least potent, & “least harmful” form of opioids. These may be facts, for the use of a few days, but it is quite the opposite for the long run. 

For instance, if you are to have a surgery that requires you to have a months supply of hydrocodone which you are told to take for at least the first few weeks of a major surgery (double jaw surgery as an example, source: me), the doctor has prescribed 10mg of liquid hydrocodone twice a day for one month. This does not mean you must take the drug daily or at that dose daily for 2-3 weeks or even close to a month. It is just there “in case” the patient needs it for a month. There were several cases of surgeries (all minor except for the jaw surgery) which I was prescribed a weeks worth of hydrocodone pills for minor operations which I found I only needed to take them only the first 2-3 days max, leaving me with over 50% of extra opioids left over for every operation I have been prescribed that drug, minor or major. 

MY STORY: 
The addicts mind is very dangerous. I was always a HUGE user of cannabis/marijuana starting from sophomore year of high school when I was suddenly extremely disabled by (IBS) daily nausea, pain, anxiety & stomach cramping. Marijuana gave me some relief. People would call me the “Snoop Dogg” or “Wiz Khalifa” of their generation. Nothing to brag about of course, but I was known for my extensive & abusive use of marijuana at the time being misinformed by articles that is was a completely non-addictive drug. This has since been proven false, and it in fact is very addictive, both physically and mentally. Withdrawals last a week, & if you are a heavy user you will find they are actually somewhat common to opioid withdrawals. Of course there are addictions MUCH worse than a daily marijuana habit, however, I was: addicted to marijuana from the age of 16, had to undergo 4 surgeries (under general anesthesia), & one very major double jaw surgery which makes that 5 total surgeries from the age of 16-21, not counting the tooth extraction where I was ALSO prescribed hydrocodone for 1 week. That’s averaging almost 1 surgery per year & being prescribed opioids once per year on average. I was a very curious child, however with a very strict mother. I was a smart child though, so I knew where to look & believe me I would look through a LOT of places until I found where my mother would hide any leftovers. I began to take them when I didn’t need them. I got high on top of them. A double habit, if you will, but I was never addicted to them until I was prescribed a months worth for my jaw surgery in liquid form, which by that time I had already been through so much mentally & physically, coming out of the OR the same day that COVID-19 lockdown started. My mouth was strapped shut 24/7 for 6 weeks straight. This operation was a reconstructive double jaw surgery, which means the doctor literally breaks open both your upper & lower jaw with a hammer, to then bolt them back together in the right place. The first week the painkillers at that dose were absolutely necessary. I could not breathe from my nose and I could hardly open my mouth due to the blood, swelling, & bruising. I got through it. After a VERY long week, I realized I had another 5 weeks of this to deal with while the entire world was in lockdown, allowing me to think this was the perfect time to just lay back for the next month & a half, taking extra doses of my painkillers along with when I did not need to take them. My prescription lasted about a month like this. When I was out, it was the worst & only withdrawals I had ever experienced. I began to buy extras off the street from friends who funnily had surgeries as well but had nearly their entire script leftover. I would start taking oxycodone. By this point, I went from needing 10mg a day to 40mg a day just to stay well. I spent $5,000 in one month just to stay well on 4 hydrocodone pills a day, while nearing the liver toxicity limit for acetaminophen. My liver was shutting down, I began searching how to “wash” the acetaminophen from the pills to cut the damage to my liver. I never figured that out, so my next reasonable option instead of having to scarf down 5 pills just to not be sick for 4 hours, was to move to heroin. By this point the risk for overdose was so low because of my hydrocodone tolerance, but what I would spend $5000 a month on just to stay well now only cost me $800/month. You can see now that was my only reasonable option along with the COVID lockdowns which made my mind create an extra excuse. $800/month turned to $2500/month. I was getting back to square one. Then, fentanyl. “Buy only $60 worth and it will last you a week!” Fast forward 3 months later & now I’m spending $5,000/month again just to stay well, but this time, on fentanyl. I was back to square one, square one on fentanyl instead of hydrocodone. I remember my first time experiencing true fentanyl withdrawal. I begged if I could go back to heroin and just withdraw from that, not even hydrocodone. Hydrocodone would have been a stroll through tall flowers. Through 5 years of addiction, I never injected any of the drugs mentioned once. Hell, I never poked myself. Always smoked. Funny enough, the only times I felt an opioid like morphine or fentanyl through IV was in a hospital post-surgery all 4 times and one separate occasion of a kidney stone as well. It felt like heaven. But I would forget it days after my operation. I’ve put myself through heroin withdrawal & beat it all in my room over the course of 5 days, but I only used for about a week. This can vary the longer you take a drug & the higher the tolerance. The truth is, I kept taking hydrocodone more & more because I thought it was nothing compared to heroin/fentanyl, and it might be nothing for someone who already has felt the hellish nightmare of fentanyl withdrawal, but for a first timer of any kind of opioid withdrawal, you need the mightiest level of willpower to beat this dependency for good. 

CONCLUSION:
Do not underestimate the power of opioids no matter what potency you are taking. Just because it happens to be one of the weakest opioid painkillers in pill form does not make it any less addictive, harmful, or powerful than heroin or fentanyl. You are setting yourself up for most horrid inevitable consequences of physical & mental opioid dependence. Just because it is a pill or just because you are smoking & not shooting up or snorting does NOT make it any less harmful or consequential. Do not fall for these illusions that come with an addicted mind like I did. We are all addicted to something, all humans have an addict mindset. However, dependence is a whole different beast. 

If you managed to real this fully, wether you are still in the beginning stages of opioid use or you have yet to even taste your first opioid, then I truly hope this post was able to open your eyes to something I wish I could read 10 years ago. I hope it makes a difference in your life. God bless.

TDLR; Hydrocodone or very weak opioid painkillers in pill form may seem like they are more acceptable to take for a longer time or a higher dose because of the fact that they are the weakest form (not heroin, morphine, fentanyl, etc) leads to an illusion which in turn causes serious mental & physical dependency in the long run.

withdrawing but still using?,3,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hc9n5f/withdrawing_but_still_using/,"Hey everyone-

So i've been using fetanyl daily for about 7 years. I did get clean and go on Suboxone for a few months about 4 years ago, but other than that, I haven't gone more than one day without using since like 2018. I use nasally, I've never used a needle or used any other way, other than sniffing it. I was pretty fortunate that I had pretty much the best plug around this area and always had pretty high-quality dope. That's not just my opinion, I know several customers who would all tell you the same thing. No other dealer compared to his stuff. They were only a few times in the past seven years where I had to use someone else's product for one reason or another, and it was just no comparison. But many of his customers would all say the same thing, nobody else had a product anywhere as close to how good and strong his dope was. But these same people will also tell you that his dope is the hardest to come off of. The withdrawal from his stuff are the worst, like 10 times worse than anyone else's product. I did use about 2.5 g a day pretty much every day for the past seven years. I've been wanting to get a clean lately, but you know how it is, just so hard. However, last week he got raided and his whole operation is done. I don't think he's ever getting out of jail. I honestly saw this as a sign from God to finally get clean. I've tried a couple other people's stuff since then, but there is really no comparison at all. for the past week, I've been doing about 1.5 g every other day. Basically just enough to keep from getting really sick. However, i'm not feeling too great and I'm having really bad stomach issues. Is it possible I'm going through withdrawals even though I'm still using because it's such a lower quality than I'm used to? I know a couple people who got clean by switching from his staff to someone else's which was lower quality, and then go cold turkey from that. They all said it made it so much easier to go cold turkey that way instead of just go in cold turkey from the higher quality stuff. I honestly didn't put 2 and 2 together until right now that the reason I'm having such bad stomach issues is because I'm withdrawing, even though I'm still using very close to the same amount that I'm used to. i'm sorry this post is so long and I'm just rambling at this point. What does this sound possible to anyone? Could I be going through with Charles even though I'm still using, because the quality is so different than what I'm used to? I desperately want to get clean and I'm hoping that I gradually reducing my intake the past few days with this lower strength Dope, it will make it easier for me to completely stop ASAP. Does anyone have any input on this? I'm so done with this drug taking over my life. I just want to get off of it completely and get my life back. Thank you for reading. I know this is a really long post. Any input is really appreciated.",12/12/24 1:21,

Xanax Physical Dependence Length - Coming off Oxycodone with Suboxone and Xanax,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hc25wg/xanax_physical_dependence_length_coming_off/,"I'm looking for some advice here as a struggling yet functioning addict who just kicked a 15 month oxycodone habit using a 7 day Suboxone detox along with prescribed Xanax.

A little background...Ive been an opioid/opiate addict for the last 10 years on and off. I started with perks, then blues, then dope. We all know how it goes. I straightened my life out when I got sentenced to drug court and was sober for 2 years. After the program I started to drink occasionally and smoke weed again after 2 years of sobriety but continued to progress in life. A year or so later, I slowly started dabbling with real Oxycodone 30s again and eventually just like that I was hooked again and went on a 15 month bender. I told myself I would never touch dope again (which I still havent) but I was doing about 90-120 mg of Oxy a day and boy has it killed my pocket. I just know its real bc I get it from the source and will never risk getting something fake on the streets with the fentanyl epidemic.

That being said, I had three 8mg subs and took little by little for 7 days to get off Oxy. I've also been taking about 1.5-2mg of prescribed xanax per day to help in these beginning stages. I am currently on day 2 of no subs and 9 days of no Oxy. Ive continued to take Xanax with one day off inbetween the 9 days. 

I feel Okay. I have some sweating going on but but my real concern is the xanax. I want to take xanax for a few more days which would make 11-12 days pretty much straight on 2mg per day. Im taking a 2mg bar at night so I can relax and sleep. My concern is I dont want to become physically dependent to this and I do not want to risk having a seizure. 

I know everyone is different but how long will it take me taking 2mg Xanax every day to build a serious dependence where I am risking having a seziure. I have had a seizure from fake xanax back in the day but I was eating 2-4 fake bars a day for a prolonged period of time. This xanax is legit. ",12/11/24 19:46,

Opiate withdrawal creates the weirdest emotional state of melancholy feelings,11,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ham1w5/opiate_withdrawal_creates_the_weirdest_emotional/,"I know some of you know what I’m talking about. The strange, dream-like-depression of all of those emotions flooding back after not feeling them for months, it gives life the straaaangest twisted tint to everything. 

Like right now, I’ve gone 8 days without suboxone after tapering down to .5mg a day, and I’ve been supplementing with kratom which has taken away the majority of all withdrawal, but today I decided I wasn’t going to dose any, and I’ve been in withdrawal all day. I’m on my phone just in pain in my bed doom scrolling YouTube shorts and these emotions are so funky. It’s like the weirdest dreamy state that I have trouble describing. A lot of hormonal feelings too, like when I watch a show or a movie, everything hits much harder in the story and characters because I’m feeling it all if you know what I’m trying to say. 

It’s bringing me back to the darkest days of my life when I would go link up with my old bummy drug addict friends and drive 35 minutes down to DC or Maryland to find someone who had fentanyl fake M30 blues. And all the times I went in and out of rehabs withdrawing like this. Idid that for two years, wasted my life. 

It’s soooo weird feeling things. And there’s this weird underlying sexual feeling too because of what opiates do to your sex drive. But I’m not going to give into temptation as I owe God my life now for saving me and how good he is to me.

Thanks to Jesus Christ and suboxone, I have my life back. Jesus is real and he saved my life, but waited till I came to the very end of myself first to reveal himself to me after mocking Christian’s and the Bible as an atheist for YEARS. Life’s weird. 

Thanks for listening to my rant. I feel horrible right now. I’m wondering if I should contact an old treatment place that take Medicaid to get the Sublocade shot, because otherwise I feel like I’m just going to be in this weird limbo-state of trying to manage the withdrawals with things like kratom and 7-OH, and end up just pushing back the withdrawal even further and further.

Some time ago I’ve seen some posts about megadosing vitamin C. Apparently it helps tremendously with withdrawal symptoms.
Does anybody have a good plan how to use vitamin C? For example I’ve seen people claiming they only took vitamin C and no further opiates and it helped. Other posts said the could lower their dosage but it’s not possible to go from 100 to 0.

The other way is taking SR-17018. I’ve also seen some people claiming it’s helpful with withdrawal. Some people even it’s the holy grail. I’ve ordered it myself and tried it. I can use it like my normal stuff and don’t get withdrawals. Apparently at the some time my tolerance is sinking (can’t tell now because just started taking it)
This stuff is pretty expensive and so I don’t want to waste it. Has anybody used it with success? If so, what was the best way? Some claim to just switch to SR17018 completely and other people say to slowly start mixing it in and then gradually increase the SR and reducing the other opiate.

Thank you very much and have a good day ",12/8/24 20:48,

It’s been about 5 months since I stopped and the other day I had some returning pain and my ENT doc prescribed me oxy. I was pretty excited, not gonna lie. I figured after 5 months off and only being on them before for around 4 months I’d have low tolerance. I took 5mg and felt absolutely nothing. Not even pain relief. The next day I just took 20mg at once and really felt next to nothing. Yes I got the pain relief but no euphoria and really not much of the energetic happy feelings I used to get (I know the dose was way smaller). So I’m assuming that tolerance just never really goes back to where you were before these things. I took 30mg so far today and feel fine. Just feel normal. Able to get things done around the house without pain. Got the kids to bed etc. just watching some TV hanging out. I guess I just wish for the short period of time I’ll be on these that I coulda had at least a little bit of euphoric times to just relax.

Backstory: been on subs for 8 years. recently got a medical procedure done, minor but still decently painful. Had the fortune/misfortune of  a great new pill hookup and got myself accustomed to the hydromorphone/oxycodone they provide. Wife’s on my case about getting back on them, and I am in agreement cuz I’ve spent about $1,500 over the last few weeks which is obviously no bueno. Not to mention my arms really need an extended period to heal back to baseline.

Last took my subs 2 weeks 5 days ago and am planning on kicking this weekend, in fact I’m about to shoot my last 30mg oxy as I write this.

I have 1 subutex and an infinite supply of suboxone. 

I’ve kicked ope’s and gotten onto subs 5 times before now but have only ever gone from Fent/H to buprenorphine. Those previous 5 times I’d hold out for as long as possible, usually 20/24 hrs before dosing with subutex.

Starting SR while staying on zenes?,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1hysurt/starting_sr_while_staying_on_zenes/,"Does anyone have any experience with starting SR before you stop your opi, then tapering the opi gradually while you take the sr?

I cut it down to about 30-50mg daily since, as I said, I feel nothing from it anyways. 
I know I should start the SR with an allergy test, then maybe another 25mg test dose, but after that should I start taking the SR in 50mg doses? And how many doses should I take per day? Also how quickly should I be tapering down my opi dose?

"SR - Tolerance Reduction - Post years of addiction, any success stories / testing? ",5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1hspzxy/sr_tolerance_reduction_post_years_of_addiction/,"As title implies, a great many anecdotal reports I'm reading praising 'SR-I7Oseven4+4, (still legal in some countries, hence writing it in a silly but understandable  way, for those who know) but, at least all I've read, they either lack context on the duration/ dose of prior addictions, or haven't seen it through. Or the ones that claim to have but give no context on how long they were addicted previously, or what life post it is like, be it abstinence or a quantifiable dose reduction. 
Maybe I'm missing some. 
Furthermore, just so these anecdotal reports could be made less anecdotal, there's a lab in Spain that accepts WW samples for UPLC-QToF testing. Anything already in the system, i.e nothing already known to the system, well then testing only serves to help keep folks alive. 
Other reason I suggest independently verifying your wares is because the majority of reports suggest Isopyne and Protopyne are not H20 soluble, however this simply isn't true. The lab came back as a Major for Isotonitazepyne; with no other Majors, Minors, active or inactive compounds present. (See my previous post or 3 for those results.)
This leads me to suspect, at least in a percentage of the reports that no 2 people are necessarily talking about the same thing, let alone what they may think they're individually talking about! It would help from both a personal safety and public safety point of view to send a sample to a lab. No matter where you are, there is at least 1 in Spain that accepts 🐌mail WW samples, anonymously. 
R.E Iso and Proto, it could be varying batches, if the synthesis differs. Could be bulking agents, or even intentionally mixed/ made with something hydrophobic, perhaps to dissuade IV use. Whose to say. Also in the absence of an independent lab test, might just not be what the individuals believe it to be. 
Some may say it's not realistic to test, but the way I figure it; Isopyne, in this SWIMS :p case, 0002 - 0024 of a singular 1000 parts (of 1mg) was = 110mg of Methadone. So the savings that folks are making, leaves a little to spare to get the wares tested, at least in some cases. Yet I can't see many results at all, just some speaking like gods on subjects that they may well be, just anyone who claims to take hundreds of milligrams of Isopyne - I have tremendous doubts that A - it's not heavily cut, B - not what they believe it is. Basing this on 0002 - 0022 out of a 1000 parts 1mg being equivalent to 110+mg of Methadone. At least in this swims experience, and this SWIM did get it independently tested. FYI context, 10 years on Opis; h to morphine, back to #3, then to beautiful #4, to Fent, and to Benzimidazole Opis. 
P.S my question pertained to any long time opi user using SR, and exactly how much their tolerance reduced? Be it going from RC's to Morphine, etc or even stopping entirely? Just read a bunch of praise but not someone whose been a long time user and gone from say hypothetically a 100+ mg equivalent of Methadone' tolerance to say sub 30mg equivalent etc, or whatever it may be. (I'm using the equivalency just because by comparing to something pharmaceutical grade then it gives us a better idea of how great a reduction, with purity lacking in the absence of a lab test. However, it really is imperative to know the Opi history too, because if it's someone who's been using for 2 months, and they thought they needed something to lessen the withdrawal, well, all I can say is it took me 6 - 12 months to develop any kind of withdrawals whatsoever. Anyway, I'll keep looking through the posts but advocate #labtesting and curious for #sucsessstories for long-term Opi users coming off or greatly reducing their tolerances?

Using DMSO as solvent for nasal spray correctly,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1hper7s/using_dmso_as_solvent_for_nasal_spray_correctly/,"A while back i got my hands onto some protonitazene which worked well for what i needed it to. I made a nasal spray as im still pretty naive to opioid RCs as a whole and made sure to use a very small dosage (believe the ratio i used was 2mg of protonitazene to 10ml of saline). The issue was that i thought it was water soluble which is entirely my fault; so it ended up not dissolving right. So after that i heated it up and mixed it which worked for like a half hour to a hour.
After a half hour pasted it would recrystalize or rerock up again so i would need to repeat  the process again.  I ended up doing that for the rest of my bag. For some reason during this process thin icicle like shards developed in my saline which as first did nothing but eventually it completely clogged and then broke both of my nasal spray bottles sadly.
During this whole ordeal i asked for some help on the sub and i was told that 1. Its not water soluble  and that 2. I should have used something like DMSO as it works for like all opioid RCs. I know what DMSO is but ive never used it myself for anything, from what little research i did its a somewhat natural ointment for use on joint pain like arthritis. On paper that doesnt aound like something you should put into your nose but obviously something im doing or the way im interpreting it is wrong.
So my question is how could i use DMSO as a solvent for my nasal spray? Do i only add a tiny bit into a nasal spray with saline and my product and then mix it or do i use the DMSO for the whole amount of liquid needed and just add my product into that? 
Any help would be appreciated, as ill be getting some more nitazene RCs here soon and would like to be able to do them with less hassle this time (also if you have anyother RC suggestions ill happily take those as well especially if they don't show on drug tests!)",12/30/24 4:15,

Here are my experiences, followed by a detailed report of the first 2 days of my 7 day SR trial:
Went from about 30gpd Kratom (shortly before that I took 500-1000mg ODSMT rectally daily for about 2-3 weeks) to about 3x 50-120mg SR per day.
Lower doses would have worked to. On some days, I tried to induce an opioid effect, which is why I redosed more often / in higher doses.
I took the SR for about 7 days & switched back to Kratom. Now on Kratom for about 13 days.
I also consumed ODSMT (a worse, less potent batch) during those 13 days on 3 separate days.
My tolerance wasn't lowered significantly after 7 days of SR use. The kratom didn't hit much stronger.
I took Kratom or ODSMT for the last 7 years, though, so I propably just need more than one week of SR maintenance to substantially reduce my tolerance.
I didn't feel any side effects from the SR.
Craving was controlled most of the time.
In high doses (100mg oral/sublingual), there was a sedative effect. No euphoria. Not really recreational.
I did have the feeling, rectal application (which I tried 4 or 5 times in doses of 40-60mg) does work.
It is kinda weird & I felt a bit bloated after that.
Not worth it since it's not water soluble imo.
I didn't feel any withdrawal effects apart from moderate craving.
I will order more soon.
I think I'm not ready to get off opioids completely right now.
So, my plan is to reduce tolerance first.
I'd like to get on SR for 2 weeks & then see how well kratom works after that.
Another interesting use would be to alternate Kratom / ODSMT use with SR (f.e. 1 day on kratom / ODSMT, then 1-3 days of SR, then 1 day of kratom/ODSMT) to potentially sustain tolerance on a steady level & reduce withdrawal
SR-17018 trial #1 (day 1/7):
First took 30mg. I still have some amphetamine in my brain & maybe a small amount of alcohol from a party I attended last night. My last line of speed was around 10h ago. My last kratom dose was 8h ago.
Didn't feel much from it.
Then I took 100mg. 1 1/2h later another 100mg. 1 1/2h later another 80mg. I feel a bit sedated. Don't have opioid craving right now. The rest Amph stimulation probably reduces the effects. I feel like I can finally sleep soon.
All doses were taken orally.
SR-17018 trial #2 (day 2/7)
Started the day with ~70mg orally. Took another 80mg in the late afternoon. Slight craving thoughts appeared, nothing major, easy to ignore. An hour after the second dose the craving went away & came again 6h later.
Now, in the night, I just dosed 50mg rectally. More like 45mg actually. I used 3ml of water. It goes to solution difficultly & crashes out as a white solid very quickly. I just applied it anyway, hoping the cloudy liquid will still work.
T+ 5min (after boofed dose): I kinda feel a nice tingling sensation in my lower body, which I often got from boofing O-DSMT. It's probably a learned reaction to the anticipation of getting my μ-opioid receptors agonised.
Whether that's purely placebo or actually due to the SR molecules reaching my brain - I don't know.
I should note that I had pretty substantial kratom (or better yet O-DSMT, which I don't have) craving half an hour ago.
I was tempted to just drink a cup of kratom juice and call it a day. But the thought of keeping this experiment going & seeing whether my tolerance will be lowered & just boofing some SR deterred me from going the tested and true kratom route.
It's now about 39h since my last kratom dose. I haven't consumed any psychotropic substance today - apart from caffeine in the afternoon & the two SR doses. If 200mg of SR could sustain me and stop the cravings, this would be a very feasible solution to my opioid use disorder.
It would cost **** a day. Way more than kratom, way less than the .5-.8g O-DSMT I used daily at times.
T +40min: I don't feel much of an opioid effect, but the craving is gone. I'm motivated to keep on continuing this experiment & just take SR for at least 7 days. Then I'll go on vacation to a different country & don't wanna take it over the border with me - so I'll switch to kratom again. If my tolerance is way lower by then, this stuff would be amazing.
Mind you - I'm making myself a lab rat here.
Worst case is that it could lead to my untimely death.
Don't experiment with it if you don't wanna take that risk.

These lines of research seem incredible. Assuming it translates to humans with J-113,397 and SR-17018 you could literally fix the two main issues of opioid use in medicine:
Tolerance. You could just package J-113,397 with another opioid and patients would never need to keep chasing a working dose. It would not only be better for them, but also cheaper and safer.
Addiction. Then you would just give them a regime of SR-17018 when they are finished and they would not have any issues. 
The only remaining significant issue would be PAWS and cravings. But I wonder if perhaps even those are unlikely to develop if you always keep the dose low and prevent tolerance.
And of course both are also optimal for addiction issues as well.

I struggle with neuropathic pain which was managed well with pregabalin, but due to its addictiveness (and it being one of my DoCs) I switched to lamotrigine.
However, lamotrigine has started causing my hair to thin, so I decreased my dose from 400 to 200mg which may have helped a bit - I have now further titrated to 150 (100mg didn't cover me well) and I'll see whether that yields any results within a few months.

~7 days on 80mg twice a day, then down to 80mg once a day for another two weeks.
One thing I have noticed that's weird is it often takes 4 hours to kick in. Almost extremely reliably it would wear off after 12.5 hours (nearly every time). I also cannot for the life of me figure out how eating impacts it, it just seems random to me (with the exception of an entirely empty stomach -that's the worst way it works, I'd say taking it then eating might be the best, but that might be some sort of bias.
Make sure not to take too much or too little. 70-90mg seems to be the working range for me. 
Does it stop cravings? Sort of. It lessens them, but they tend to show up around 7.5 hours for me (for maybe 2 hours).
Edit: 
Also I highly recommend NOT storing it in the freezer like others suggest. At least in a current UK-like climate. I did and it absorbed a bunch of water (I tried to seal it, but evidently even a small crack allowed it to do this), and I was seriously concerned I had damaged it. The worries about it having a short half life under ambient conditions do not seem founded to me.

SR-17018 FAQ,20,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1hcgsfl/sr17018_faq/,"Hi guys! 
I’ve noticed that searching for information on SR-17018 is really difficult. All of the experience reports are spread out and hard to find, and posts frequently get deleted as time goes on. I figured I was not the only one having the same problem finding reliable information on SR-17018. 
I’m extremely excited to announce that I’ve finally finished putting together my [SR-17018 Masterdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ibgxFT9z9bHqQn7HftNGfOxfiBDyU1fK0QMWSfLkvSM/edit?usp=sharing). It contains all of the experience reports I could find on Reddit about SR-17018. I used the information I learned along with my own personal experience using SR-17018 to quit kratom to create an automated taper schedule generator on Google Sheets as well. Links to both will be at the bottom of this post, and they will be updated frequently as more information comes out and more people post about this miracle substance. 
For those of you who don’t have the time to look through the whole Google doc, I’m going to put an FAQ below. 
*Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional, and the information provided herein should not be construed as medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider before making any decisions related to your health or treatment. The content provided is for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for professional medical advice.*
SR-17018 is a biased G-protein mu-opioid receptor agonist. This means that when it binds to the mu-opioid receptor, it has a strong preference for G-protein signaling rather than beta-arrestin signaling. Researchers haven’t quite figured out the mechanism for why this happens just yet, but for some reason, taking SR-17018 can both **stop opioid withdrawal symptoms** and **reverse tolerance to opioids**. And because of its bias *away* from beta-arrestin, it has **minimal respiratory depression** compared to something like morphine or fentanyl. 
So, basically: if you have been trying to get off of opioids to no avail, SR-17018 *may* help you quit.
Sorry, but I can’t help you with that. If you do end up finding some, please be extremely cautious as it may not be legitimate. 
SR-17018 is insoluble in water and PG, meaning that you have to take it **orally**. It is soluble in 10:10:80 DMSO/Tween-80 (polysorbate 80)/water, so if you really want to, you can make a solution for oral dosing with that. But you cannot snort, boof, or shoot it. 
**No.** Although it has an impressive ability to attenuate opioid withdrawal symptoms, SR-17018 has not been reported to have any recreational effects, and does not produce euphoria. 
The jury is still out on this one. Some people report SR-17018 helping with withdrawals, but most of the reports I’ve seen have said that it does **not** have analgesic effects. It *may* help opioid-naive people with pain management, but personally, I experienced a pretty sharp increase in my chronic pain when I switched to it from my 300 mg/day mitragynine habit. 
Yes, although if you are doing this, you must exercise **extreme caution**. At least one person has reportedly **died** from an overdose after reducing their tolerance to opioids using SR-17018. 
**Nobody can answer this question yet.** It doesn’t seem to induce respiratory depression at doses below 150 mg. It also appears to be relatively harmless to mice according to available scientific literature. But nobody will know the long-term effects of SR-17018 on humans for a long time. I personally tolerate it very well and have not noticed any negative side effects while taking it. But I think that it’s *very* important that you only take enough to keep withdrawals at bay and that you stay on the drug for as short of a period as possible: the truth is that nobody knows how it could be affecting our bodies and brains, especially long-term.
As of December 12, 2024, SR-17018 is legal for research purposes. It is not legal for human consumption, but in my opinion, unless you are buying hundreds of grams of the stuff or getting caught with mystery white powder in your car when you get pulled over, you are not likely to be at risk of legal trouble for ordering it. 
When transitioning to SR-17018 from another opioid, there are two main approaches that have been reported on Reddit. **Both have been shown to work**, so it’s up to you.
* **Immediate Transition:** Discontinuing the current opioid and initiating SR-17018 immediately. Pros of this approach: 
   * It’s safer (you will not have to continually guess where your tolerance is at and will not risk taking too much of your DOC as your tolerance reduces).
   * It’s faster.
   * You will use less SR-17018 overall, which may be an advantage if you are strapped for cash or not able to get SR-17018 consistently.
   * You do not have to rely on willpower to taper down on your drug of choice. When you quit it, you can be done with making that decision. 
* **Gradual Transition:** Tapering the dosage of the current opioid down while taking SR-17018 to mitigate withdrawals, then switching to it when your DOC dosage is low enough. SR-17018 does not cause precipitated withdrawals, so it is completely possible to use it concurrently with your opioid of choice to more gradually reduce tolerance before jumping off completely. Pros of this approach: 
   * You will likely experience less withdrawal symptoms compared to the immediate transition approach. 
Reports from Reddit say that **SR-17018 lasts anywhere from 6-12 hours**, with most people saying it lasts around eight hours. In my experience, it takes about 30 minutes after a dose to start noticing improvements in withdrawal symptoms. These improvements peak about 2 hours after dosing and this peak lasts for 5-6 hours (7-8 hours total). After the peak, the effects wane off over the course of 1-2 hours. Because of this effects timeline, **one dose every eight hours** works the best for me. 
I’ve seen reports of success with starting doses **anywhere from 25 mg to 150 mg**. Your exact dosage is going to be dependent on a lot of factors: how much you weigh, how quickly you metabolize SR-17018, and your current opioid consumption will all influence this answer. As an example, someone who had been taking kratom reported needing 150 mg doses every eight hours to get relief, while someone else switching to SR-17018 from zenes said 50 mg every twelve hours was enough. **The best way to figure out how much you should take is experimentation.** I explain how to (more) safely experiment with SR-17018 dosages in-depth in my taper guide. 
Additionally, it is not known what the morphine milligram equivalent (MME) conversion factor of SR-17018 in humans is. In rats, 1 mg of SR-17018 is equivalent to 1 mg of morphine. In my experience, however, this does not translate very well. **The potency of SR-17018 does not seem to increase linearly with dosage**: the difference in effects between 10 mg and 25 mg is larger than the difference between 25 and 40, which is larger than the difference between 40 and 55. I’d say the benefits hit a quasi-ceiling effect at around 100 mg per dose: anything above 100 mg will not really be all that much better at helping with withdrawals than just taking 100 mg. 
Another important thing to mention is that smaller, more frequent doses are likely going to be much better at managing withdrawal symptoms than larger, less frequent doses. At the beginning of my switch over to SR-17018, after my allergy test, I took **25 mg every two hours until my withdrawals were manageable**. I figured out over the course of about 32 hours with a lot of experimenting (and religious dose logging!) that 65 mg every eight hours is my optimal dose. I would not recommend taking SR-17018 more frequently than every two hours because of how long it takes to fully kick in. You don’t want to accidentally overdo it.

*Disclaimer: This information is for general knowledge only and does not constitute medical advice. If you are looking for medical advice, please speak with a qualified healthcare provider and above all, listen to your body.*
When transitioning to SR-17018 from another opioid, there are two primary approaches. Reports on Reddit suggest that both approaches can be effective.
* **Immediate Transition:** Discontinuing the current opioid and initiating SR-17018 immediately.
* **Gradual Transition:** Tapering the dosage of the current opioid down while taking SR-17018 to mitigate withdrawals.
I personally have found success with a structured protocol involving an immediate transition and three distinct phases (after the initial allergy test):
* **Calibration Phase:** This initial period focuses on establishing the appropriate SR-17018 dosage to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms and provide adequate relief from withdrawal symptoms. (For me, this lasted three days.)
* **Maintenance Phase:** Once the optimal dosage is determined, it is maintained consistently for at least four days (but preferably seven days or longer) to provide stabilization and reduce opioid tolerance. (I will be spending seven days in the Maintenance Phase.)
* **Tapering Phase:** The SR-17018 dosage is gradually reduced over at least three days (but preferably longer) to facilitate a smooth transition off of SR-17018 while minimizing any potential discomfort. (I plan to taper off of SR-17018 over the course of ten days.)
Given that SR-17018 has an estimated half-life of 8-12 hours, dosing frequency generally aligns with this timeframe. In the maintenance and tapering phases, people typically take SR-17018 every 8 or 12 hours, depending on their individual needs and response.
The Calibration Phase requires a different approach. During this initial period, a lower dose of SR-17018 (usually between 20 to 35 mg) is recommended, with a minimum of two hours between doses. This flexible dosing schedule allows individuals to adjust their SR-17018 intake based on the severity of their withdrawal symptoms, ensuring adequate relief while minimizing the risk of overdoing it.
I just want to emphasize again though that this is just one example of a potential approach, and it may not be suitable for everyone. Above all else, *always* listen to your body when you’re using SR-17018 to come off of opioids and focus on feeling well.
*Disclaimer: This information is based on my personal experiences and should not be considered medical advice. Always listen to your body and prioritize your well-being throughout any process related to your health.*
To assist those utilizing SR-17018 for opioid cessation, I've developed an [automated taper generation spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AceaCoGHIn6fK-6r1IInWLEi0aRsjUgWRR-BrzjXjyk/edit?usp=sharing). The following tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to effectively utilize this tool to create a personalized taper schedule. This is also available in my [SR-17018 Masterdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ibgxFT9z9bHqQn7HftNGfOxfiBDyU1fK0QMWSfLkvSM/edit?usp=sharing), where I compiled every experience report I could find on Reddit about SR-17018 and wrote an FAQ (to be posted on Reddit soon). Go check it out!
**1. Personalize Your Taper Schedule.** 
Begin by opening the Google Sheets file [SR-17018 Taper Schedule Generator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AceaCoGHIn6fK-6r1IInWLEi0aRsjUgWRR-BrzjXjyk/edit?usp=sharing) and making a copy for your personal use. Navigate to the ""Blank Auto-Generating Taper Schedule"" tab. Here, you'll input the following parameters to generate your taper plan tailored to your specific circumstances and goals:
* **Anticipated Start Date:** Enter the date you plan to begin taking SR-17018.
* **Calibration Period:** Specify the number of days you intend to allocate for the Calibration Phase. This period allows you to adjust to SR-17018 and determine your optimal dosage. I went with three days, but you can adjust this based on your individual needs.
* **Maintenance Dosage:** Input the SR-17018 dosage you settled on after completing the Calibration Phase. This is the maintenance dose you'll sustain before initiating the taper.
* **Dosing Interval:** Select your preferred dosing frequency from the provided options: every 6 hours, every 8 hours, or every 12 hours. While every 8 hours is a common choice, you can adjust this based on how quickly you personally seem to metabolize SR-17018.
* **Maintenance Duration:** Specify the number of days you plan to remain on your maintenance dose. This maintenance period is crucial for stabilizing your system and reducing your tolerance before tapering off of SR-17018. A duration of 4-7 days is generally recommended, but this can be extended based on factors such as the half-life of your previous opioid. (Generally, the longer the half-life, the longer the duration of the Maintenance Phase). 
* **Tapering Duration:** Determine the number of days you'll allocate for gradually reducing your SR-17018 dosage. Longer taper durations generally promote a smoother transition with less discomfort. I plan on tapering over the course of ten days, but as always, you should adjust the length based on your individual preferences and needs.
**2. Do an Allergy Test.** 
Before initiating your SR-17018 taper, it's crucial to prioritize safety by conducting an allergy test. This involves taking a small dose of SR-17018 (less than 5 mg) and carefully monitoring for any signs of an allergic reaction. While allergic reactions vary, common signs include skin rashes or hives, itching, swelling (especially of the face, lips, or tongue), or difficulty breathing or wheezing. If you experience any of these symptoms after the allergy test, please discontinue SR-17018 immediately and seek medical attention.
**3. Start Low When You Start Your Taper.** 
On the day you choose to discontinue your previous opioid, start taking the SR-17018. Start with a low dose of SR-17018, such as 25 mg and log it in the spreadsheet. Enter the date, time, and dosage into the dose log section highlighted in yellow in your taper schedule spreadsheet. This meticulous record-keeping helps monitor your progress and make informed adjustments as needed.
**4. Fine-Tune Your Dosage During Calibration.** 
After taking your initial dose, the Calibration Phase involves a careful process of self-assessment and dosage adjustment:
* **Individualized Threshold:** Determine your personal threshold for ""intolerable"" withdrawal symptoms. This is the point at which your discomfort becomes unmanageable and necessitates another dose of SR-17018. It can be helpful to use a scale to rate withdrawal severity, for example, from 1 to 10, with 1 being minimal discomfort and 10 being the worst withdrawal symptoms you have ever experienced.
* **Observe and Assess:** Wait **at least two hours** after your initial dose, and attentively monitor your withdrawal symptoms. Here are some symptoms of opioid withdrawal, from the website healthdirect: 
   * hot and cold flushes, sweating and 'goosebumps'
   * feeling anxious or irritable
   * cravings for opioids
   * nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and lack of appetite
   * tremor (shaking)
   * watery eyes, runny nose and sneezing
   * yawning and disturbed sleep
   * different types of pain, including joint, bone or muscle pain, abdominal (stomach area) pain or headaches
* **Adjust as Needed:** If your withdrawal symptoms exceed your tolerance threshold after the two-hour waiting period, take another dose of SR-17018. 
* **Meticulous Record-Keeping:** It's crucial to maintain detailed records of your doses throughout the Calibration Phase. In your spreadsheet, log each dose, including the amount taken and the date and precise time of day. This information will be invaluable in establishing your optimal maintenance dose.
* **Dosage Flexibility:** If your initial dose (e.g., 25 mg) proves insufficient to manage your withdrawal symptoms effectively, consider increasing the dose for subsequent administrations (e.g., to 50 mg). 
* **Prioritize Self-Care:** Always maintain adequate hydration and nutrition throughout this process. Keep yourself busy, but remember to make sure you’re getting adequate rest as well. The best thing you can do to feel better is distract yourself by working on something you’re passionate about or spending time speaking with loved ones. 
**5. Calculate Your Maintenance Dose.** 
Once you’ve settled into a rhythm that effectively manages withdrawal symptoms, it’s time to calculate your maintenance dose of SR-17018, which you will take every 8 (or 6, or 12) hours during the Maintenance Phase. To do this, simply review your dose log from the Calibration Phase. Calculate the total amount of SR-17018 you've taken within the past 8 hours (or whichever interval you selected) that effectively managed your withdrawal symptoms and brought you to a comfortable state. This 8-hour total is your starting maintenance dose.
**6. Start the Maintenance Phase.** 
Now that you've established your baseline maintenance dose, it's time to settle into the rhythm of the Maintenance Phase. This involves consistent dosing while remaining adaptable to your body's needs.
* **Eight-Hour Intervals:** Approximately eight (or 6, or 12) hours after your first maintenance dose (the total amount you calculated in Step 6), take that same dose again. Continue this pattern, taking your established dose at the interval you decided on. 
* **The Importance of Dosage Flexibility:** While consistency is key during the Maintenance Phase, it's important to recognize that individual needs can fluctuate. Factors such as stress, sleep disturbances, or changes in your environment can influence withdrawal symptom intensity. Allowing for dosage flexibility ensures that you can adapt to these variations and maintain a comfortable level of relief.
**7. Start Tapering.** 
Once you are consistently no longer experiencing withdrawals at the Maintenance dose, you are ready for the Tapering Phase, which involves the gradual reduction of your SR-17018 dosage. Your spreadsheet will provide a personalized tapering schedule based on the duration and maintenance dosage you specified. For example, if you indicated a 10-day taper, you'll reduce your dose by 10% each day.
* **Flexibility and Responsiveness:** While the spreadsheet offers a structured tapering plan, it's crucial to remain flexible and responsive to your body's signals. If you experience intolerable withdrawal symptoms at any point during the taper, slow down your taper: stay at the current dose until your symptoms subside and you feel comfortable proceeding.
**8. Complete Your Taper.** 
The taper is completed when you feel comfortable at 0 mg/day. If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You are now opioid-free. 
* **Sustaining Your Progress:** After completing your taper, you must remain vigilant and proactive in maintaining your new opioid-free lifestyle. This may involve seeking ongoing support, engaging in relapse prevention strategies, and cultivating healthy coping mechanisms. It may also involve taking a low dose of SR-17018 twice daily, as many users on Reddit have reported that taking it significantly reduced their cravings. 
* **A Word of Caution:** If, for any reason, you find yourself considering a return to opioid use after completing this taper, you need to exercise extreme caution. Your tolerance will have significantly decreased, and what you previously used may now be a potentially fatal dose. The risk of overdose is very real, and it's crucial to prioritize your safety above all else.

A hopeful love letter (ramble),6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1hap2w6/a_hopeful_love_letter_ramble/," SR-17018. My Hail Mary. My hope is that our bodies will recover.
  As we’ve seen, I am sure that it holds amazing potential for addiction recovery. I have not known sober for years. I’ve been talking myself through it for days.  I’m so hopeful that this is going to work. 
  Unlike traditional opioid agonists, SR-17018 reportedly does not produce precipitated withdrawal symptoms such as cold sweats, nausea, or the long-lasting post-acute withdrawal effects like heart rate spikes and restlessness. It is known to reset the body’s tolerance to opioids, apparently (hopefully!) offering individuals the rare possibility of true recovery without the chemical dependence. 
  It seems like the pancea we’ve all dreamed of. It’s the next big thing. Because of that, in a month or less when benefits become widely known, it will be suppressed due to its capacity to disrupt the highly profitable opioid treatment industry. Any solution that could effectively curb opiod misuse poses a direct threat.
The opioid epidemic has devastated my home, Appalachia has been hit hard with every new wave. We’ve “oxycuted” a whole generation. 
 
""The Lost Generation.""
 I am 23. A couple years too old to be the children born to those in the true first wave. Yeah, Y’all are that old. Kidding. But not. Most everyone I know in the game is 12-15 years or more older than me. 
 So so many of my peers were raised by grandparents or other relatives due to addiction, myself included, leaving those now transitioning into adulthood with a lack of guidance and support. We are young and are smarter than ALL OF YOU!! You know how it is.
 I just hope that we can make it through this switch that’s about to be flipped. 
  I’ve never went on the street thinking I’m buying heroin. 6 years using anniversary December 1st 🥇 That’s the age we are in. We have strayed that far from the starting point. 
  4 years ago I fell at work and was unable to walk for 6 months, I found out I have tumors in my hips. They won’t kill me, I just walk with a limp like a wounded dog wishing to be put down. Anywho.  If I was 10 years older I’d be GOLDEN. Set for lifeeeee. But noOoOOOooOoOOo I can’t even get a neurotin and I have to wait until I’m post menopausal to be able to get my hips done 😤. 
  I want to be able to get heroin. I want to catch a nod off that. I want to try fetty through the street randomly one day without knowing and OD. I want to have a maintenance methadone dose of less than 100mg. 
  Thousands of times stronger than fent. It blows my mind. I seriously hope that the zenes disappear and the kids growing up today will have a bright future of addiction ahead. There’s no reason to have a tolerance like the average street user does todays. As long as they don’t forget our past or they will repeat it. 
   20 million people in America struggle with misuse of substances yet all we have is subs and methadone??? It’s obvious if you live in an area with a lot of drug use what is going on. 
 
  It’s the cycle. Relapse.Rehab.Methadone.Subs. 
  As we know OxyContin and Suboxone are owned by the same people, we know the truth: 
‼️‼️The pharmaceutical industry is a trap that we have no choice but to accept under current law. ‼️‼️
  The addiction treatment sector, which thrives on high relapse rates and inflated Medicaid reimbursements, is valued at over $430 billion annually—this money flows back in only furthering the ultra rich. As a result, any effective alternative like SR-17018 threatens to disrupt this cycle and the immense profit it generates.
  Personally, I am deeply assured about SR-17018’s potential as MAT. I can’t wait for it to get here. This to me is the opportunity of a lifetime that I didn’t know I’ve been waiting for., However, the reality is that this substance will be suppressed, patented, and/or made illegal to protect the interests of the pharmaceutical industry.
  On the West Coast—when the supply of fake presses dried up around July, many were left without access to street opioids for nearly a month, causing tolerances to bottom out. With the introduction of new xylazine powder, it led to a surge in overdose deaths, particularly among democratic populations aged between 18-40.
  The personal experiences from those who have used it to completely stop using opioids are incredibly promising and personally reading them has brought me out of a months long suicidal depression and I am now so hopeful that in a few weeks I will finally be free after nearly 6 years of 0 clean time ever. 
  If this information spreads, SR-17018 will be suppressed to maintain the profit-driven cycle of addiction treatment. The future of America depends on it whether we can advocate for research chemicals like SR-17018 to be moved into a separate, non-scheduled class so they can be studied freely before the pharmaceutical industry silences them.
  As new, stronger synthetic analogs continue to be imported, they will lead dealers to buy the most potent product cause it hold the most cut. 
   We are at a pivotal moment. A rare opportunity to break a cycle and support the younger generations like WE needed. We need to do what we can to not let a third generation be lost to lining the pockets of the rich constantly relapsing while they hide effective forms of harm reduction so that Medicaid can fund their yacht.

Spirochlorph...: This compound doesn’t have an immediate effect. After a few foil smokes, you give up because it doesn’t hit right away. However, eventually, it puts you to sleep, and you wake up in a state of pleasant warmth and mild euphoria. It’s subtle, almost underwhelming.
Cyclorphyne: On the other hand, this is an ultra-powerful monster. It knocks you out for hours, and that’s it. It’s only slightly dissociative, but soon after, it completely sedates you. Its effects are more comparable to a benzodiazepine than a traditional opioid. Not much else to it. Not euphoric 
In my opinion, both compounds are quite disappointing. Thankfully, there are still remnants of Protonitazepyne and Isotonitazepyne available, though at a steep price.

What nitazenes are still quasi-legal and carry typical opioid traits? ,11,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1h7dllh/what_nitazenes_are_still_quasilegal_and_carry/,"Hi all, 
Just looking for a straight answer on this one. I’m already a long time heroin and fent user; I  understand the risks and have done nitazenes several times before, so please just stick to the topic. 
I’m curious as to which currently legal nitazenes (or spiro/cyclo) is best? I am looking for something extremely potent- ODSMT, 7-oh etc are not solutions here. I’m hoping for classic opioid feelings like Warmth, itchiness, euphoria etc. I know this is a bit difficult to find, but suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
I can easily find cyclo and spiro, but unless I actually hear some good things on them i would much rather see what else is out. Let me know your thoughts, thank you in advance!!

Question about SR-17018 dosage ,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1h7a33z/question_about_sr17018_dosage/,"Hey everyone I'm looking for some information. I see people saying they usually start out with around 100mg of SR-17018 a couple times a day. I've seen its equivalent to the strength of morphine, so since I'm using fentanyl I'm guessing ill need more than 100 mgs at first?
Also does anyone know a better way to take it than capsules? I've seen people say it takes a hour or 2 to work once taken. Can I just rub it on my gums for a faster response or possibly snort it?",12/5/24 14:13,

Any Experience With SR-17018,14,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1h0d9yw/any_experience_with_sr17018/,"Good afternoon, I’ve got some questions regarding SR-17018. Looking to find out more information and even people’s experiences with this particular chem. 
  I’ve read some scientific reports stating it can help decrease the tolerance for morphine in rats. I’ve read posts anecdotal reports of some people’s experiences.
  From what I gather It’s specific opioid agonist, working in a different way than full agonists and partial agonists. I’ve been taking kratom for years and started taking 7-oh products daily. Now my tolerance is high and start getting withdrawals if I don’t take any. If I go without the 7-oh I feel a bit of withdrawal and it’s uncomfortable but manageable (especially if I’m home, while at work it take more due to the high stress and anxiety of my job)
  Anyway this substance sparked my interest. I definitely want to get off kratom and only use when needed and not daily. I was looking into IBOGA but it’s illegal in the US so I was looking into some IBoga clinics and it costs thousands of dollars (not including the plane ticket) so unfortunately I won’t be able to use IBOGA, if I had money, time and resources I would definitely use it. 
  So I got an interest in SR-17018 due to many people saying it helped them significantly lower their dose and even completely stop with no withdrawal (some people were on hard stuff like fent and zenes). Can anyone give more Information even share their experience? Maybe some info on strength, dosage and best ROA. Anything will help. There’s limited information I can find so definitely want to be more informed.",11/26/24 14:34,

I’m working on creating a harm reduction guide for zenes and would love to hear people’s experiences with them and advice - it’ll be specifically focusing on the following, but please add anything else you feel is important or relevant! 
- Different types of zenes and a very approximate lineup of potency (dosage if possible) 
- Harm reduction advice for a variety of ROAs 
- Any anecdotal experiences you’ve had (such as unexpected withdrawal, how long it took to change your tolerance/dependency)
- Experience with tapering off or down; Opiate Assisted Treatment, and/or SR-17018, anything different you’ve noticed about zene  withdrawal compared to other opioids, or even other zenes
If you know of any other helpful threads or resources, please let me know! I’m based in the UK, but hoping to make the guide helpful for anyone anywhere, especially considering there’s very little in the way of “actual” research or guidance. 
Note: Please don’t comment “don’t use zenes”! The guide will be targeted to/ is for people who are already on zenes or are just starting out. There will of course be a note at the beginning which  highlights associated risks and emphasises how potent they are, as well as clarifying that a lot of the guidance is not necessarily backed up by research. This is for users by users, with the aim of reducing risk.

My SR-17018 experience.,16,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1gqgzwl/my_sr17018_experience/,"When I tried SR-17018 at a moderate-to-strong dose of 25 mg, it was unlike any opioid I’ve used before, yet it carried hints of similarity to drugs like buprenorphine or tapentadol—but with its own unique character.
Onset and Initial Effects:
The onset was slower, taking about 1.5 hours to fully set in, which reminded me of buprenorphine’s delayed rise. The effects crept up subtly, and suddenly I noticed this calming warmth wrapping around me. It wasn’t a rush or an immediate hit like a typical opioid but more of a gradual build into a steady, manageable high.
Euphoria and Clarity:
What struck me most was the clarity of the experience. SR-17018 had a very clean euphoric quality—not overpowering or overwhelming. The mood lift was noticeable but not as “loud” as something like morphine or oxycodone. Instead, it was more akin to tapentadol, where the euphoria felt understated but still enjoyable, almost functional. I felt content and calm, but my mind stayed sharp, which is rare for an opioid.
Body High:
The physical effects were there but mild compared to classic opioids. It provided a warm, soothing sensation, but it lacked that heavy body-numbing effect you’d get from something like hydromorphone. This made it feel somewhat functional—you could enjoy the relaxation without being glued to the couch.
Sedation and Duration:
Sedation was light but present. It wasn’t something that knocked me out or made me too drowsy unless I was already tired. The duration was long, stretching over 6–8 hours, with a gradual and smooth comedown. It reminded me a bit of how buprenorphine lingers without feeling too oppressive.
Overall Feel:
SR-17018 felt like an opioid for someone who wants relief, relaxation, and mild euphoria without being overwhelmed.

Comparing my Odsmt experience vs my 7oh experience ,8,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1gqgxxn/comparing_my_odsmt_experience_vs_my_7oh_experience/,"When I took 20 mg of 7-Hydroxy-Mitrogynine (7-OH), which is considered a strong dose, the experience was powerful but fundamentally different from 75 mg of O-Desmethyltramadol (ODSMT).
Euphoria and Mental Effects:
ODSMT at 75 mg hit with a sharper, almost electric euphoria, lifting my mood and making everything seem brighter and more engaging. In contrast, 20 mg of 7-OH brought a much deeper sense of calm and serenity. The euphoria was there, but it was more understated—like a warm blanket for my mind rather than the exhilarating buzz ODSMT delivered. 7-OH felt meditative and introspective, perfect for zoning out and relaxing deeply.
Body High:
The physical sensations were also distinct. ODSMT felt heavier on my body, with waves of opioid numbness that were both comforting and a little overwhelming at times. The 7-OH body high was less intense but more fluid, giving me a warm, relaxed sensation that felt natural and soothing without the same narcotic weight.
Sedation:
ODSMT took a few hours to fully sedate me, whereas 7-OH hit hard with a relaxing and almost couch-locking effect early on. At 20 mg, 7-OH was intensely sedating and calming, pulling me into a restful state quickly, while ODSMT had more of a stimulating edge before the sedation kicked in.
Both are strong in their own ways, but ODSMT felt more recreational and euphoric, while 7-OH was a more profound, deeply relaxing experience.",11/13/24 16:31,

First time taking 75mg ODSMT,10,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1gp09on/first_time_taking_75mg_odsmt/,"ODSMT at 75 mg felt like a different experience from morphine, though there are similarities. Both drugs produce that warm, full-body opioid sensation, but ODSMT feels more energizing and euphoric initially, while morphine is generally heavier and more sedative right from the start. ODSMT brought a noticeable mood lift and a sense of contentment, making everything seem lighter and more enjoyable. Music was enhanced, and I felt this calm euphoria that I don’t usually get as strongly with morphine.
With morphine, the high is typically more straightforward and purely sedating, making you feel deeply relaxed and more inclined to just sink into wherever you are. Morphine has a stronger pull toward drowsiness and physical relaxation, almost numbing you to the core, while ODSMT feels less likely to knock you out in the same way, at least until later in the experience when sedation becomes more pronounced.
I also found that morphine’s effects tend to feel heavier on the body, while ODSMT, even with the body load, felt a bit “lighter” in effect, as if it had a slight stimulant edge to it. Both have their place, but ODSMT feels more recreational due to its blend of euphoria and mental clarification.",11/11/24 19:08,

7:45: Took 10mg orally
Its been about 30 min and I don’t feel any different. My last dose of 75mg methadone was yesterday morning at around 8AM. This usually holds me through until about noon the following day.
8:45: Taking 25mg more orally just incase since I’m not sure how long the onset takes and I want it to be in effect when my withdrawal normally starts.
9:30: still haven’t notice any effect whatsoever.
11:00: currently not feeling any recreational effects nor any withdrawal symptoms, other than some compulsive yawning. 
4:00: Started feeling a little temperature fluctuation and very excessive yawning so I decided to take 50mg.
11:30: Still feeling okay. No bad withdrawal symptoms. Not even diarrhea which is usually one of the first ones. This is incredible. Going to try and get some sleep.
DAY 2
9:00: Woke up feeling completely fine. Slept like a baby. Took 50mg more just incase it starts wearing off as most reports show two doses daily.
11:00: Today I’ve definitely noticed a lot more temperature disregulation as well as some chills. But two days without methadone would normally have me on my knees praying for mercy, so this is absolutely nothing compared to that.
2:30: Still feeling the same as I did this morning. I did have a couple drinks, which helped with the cold chills.
6:00: Took another 50mg and went home and slept.
Day 3
9:00: decided to take 40mg of methadone to see how my tolerance has been affected. The 40mg seems to have me stable.
Been tapering down on the SR since Day 4. No major withdrawal symptoms other than temperature disregulation. I’m currently on Day 8. God bless.

I was recently able to get a g of O-DSMT for $34 but can't get that price anymore. Seeing it $65 a g elsewhere.  Grams of 7oh go for $80+ and have questionable purity. 
-------
With tianeptine though all forms go for about $25 and they list 2g but give you anywhere from 3-4g. My recent buy clocked in  at at 4g exactly, prompting a reorder probably coming a day after i run out. Best deal I can get 7oh wise is 5 18mg tabs for $18. I would take 5 tabs that day though where with 4g tianeptine sodium I've got 2-3 days worth. O-DSMT gs last a day and a half. Tianeptines wacky dirty feeling keeps me from dosing it too much. I just have been wanting to make the best out of a bad situation.

I wish there were still vendors with AP-38 but that all seems to have dried up.  I've been under a bad cloud lately. Been getting scammed then someone who used to hold me down with some pharma is drawing a line in the sand about me asking for hydros when I get sick.

Tranq question ,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1g9byk2/tranq_question/,"So I know nothing of this stuff. I'm from the streets , I don't mess with darkweb or source anything online . I am done with drugs myself but I like to learn about the online culture side since I was a different side of things .
Anyway, I hear people talk about this xylazine nonstop. They hit something that is bad, oh it's got effin tranq innit. (As if the good stuff doesnt have it too, if it is that widespread as they make it out to be)
Does it have a taste? Smell ? What's it's look like ? White powder ? Does it give the fetty a distinct taste? 
Let's say every bad crap you had tested POS+ for xylazine , what makes every batch that has it the same and noticeably tranqued ? 
I feel like Ashton is gonna pop out of a tire on the Pacific coast highway and be like ""you've been tranqued!!""
Anyway I'm just curious. Sorry y'all have to deal with it. I quit the game right before this . Fact a nursedoctor in jail told me about it and said since I did fentanyl that I have a blood pressure disorder caused by the xylazine  they put in the dope I used.(Which he states is a monkey tranquilizer) .
Which led me to believe he was some kinda top dog to have that kinda factual knowledge so of course I believed him and started asking and telling everyone that ""dem dayum messickans izputtin monkey tranquilizer inner dope,even thuh we didunt feckin ask ferrit, whyzat??""  
""Noweye gots dis dayum monkey blood disease, and theys all laffinetme "" 
So yes I'm pretty curious still about it. Since apparently i got monkeypox from something someone's putting in perfectly good product, that isn't being wanted or asked for , just for the uh fun of it I guess ? Sounds like a waste of time and money to me and we all know how much they like to waste time and money.
I mean do people really believe a drug cartel making a batch of dope the same way everytime , decides to stop what their doing, seek out , buy, and add some weird chemical to the dope, changing the formula they taught a bunch a people how to do , costing time and money , all for people to complain about ? 
I mean the cost of xylazine is the same as fentanyl, why put it in if no one asked for it..... The cuts and additives cost more then the dope itself . Before you say someone had to have asked for it. No , no they didn't. Some white boy pressing his own blues here in the usa decided to do that shit. That's who always does this type of shit. 
(Edited to clean up paragraphs)
I hope this doesn't fall under drug identification request, cause that's not what I'm going for here.. I'm just purely curious what makes everyone know that it's in their crap , unless everyone has xylazine testers and if that's the case , then my question is answered.",10/22/24 6:48,

Volumetric Dosing Guide,18,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1g8c4wp/volumetric_dosing_guide/,"Volumetric dosing is a relatively easy way to accurately dose substances in the sub-milligram range. It involves dissolving a known quantity of a substance in a known quantity of liquid, from there it's very easy to find the concentration of the substance on a milliliter basis.
Many of the substances we run into in the RC world are active at sub-milligram doses. These types of drugs require extreme precision that can't be achieved with consumer grade scales. Volumetric dosing is the only way to accurately dose the sub-milligram range in a safe and reliable manner.
There are three main reasons for volumetric dilution of a substance: diluting a substance down to a safe range for use below the capacity of available scale, diluting a substance down to a safe range below a threshold dosage to test for adverse reactions and diluting a substance down to a low micro gram dose to test that it is not a much more powerful substance then believed- ie: isotonitazepyne.
**Tools Required**
* A milligram scale
* Graduated cylinder or syringe with ml markings
* Small funnel
* Glass vials or bottles
* Liquid for dilution eg: ethanol, high proof alcohol, water, propylene glycol
**How to calculate a volumetric solution**
1) Research what your substance can be dissolved in, and at what concentrations. Some substances are not readily soluble in water, and instead need a strong spirit such as Everclear or propylene glycol. Sometimes, it is necessary to use a stronger solute when a higher concentration is desired.
2) Take the substance you wish to dissolve, and weigh it with an accurate milligram scale. Generally you measure out a substantial amount more than you intend on dosing, to increase the margin of error.
3) Once you have a known quantity, you need to decide what concentration you want it. For example, if I have 100mg of a substance in powder, and I want 500µg in every milliliter of solute (A concentration of 500µg/ml) I would need 200mL of solute.
4) The concentration can be calculated with the following formula:
- quantity of substance / amount of solute = concentration.
 
- Ex. 100mg/200mL=500µg per ml
- Remember: The lower the concentration, the easier and safer it is to dose! Ensure your margin for error is as high as necessary.
**Safety**
When dealing with chemicals active in the sub milligram range, there is substantial risk of accidentally dosing oneself while working with the chemical. Necessary precautions must be taken to ensure safety.
* Gloves, dust mask, and eye protection are required
* Wipe down all surfaces as soon as you're done using them.
* Do not work with substances in an area with a breeze.
* **Just because you can't see it, does not mean there is nothing there.** Chemicals active at quantities this low can be very hard for the human eye to detect.
* Absolutely do not touch your eyes, ears, nose, or mouth while working with powders.
* **You should mark the bottles in some way.** This avoids confusion while doing this and is vitally important if they are stored. You may think they will remember what's what, especially if there are differences in the bottles, but **DON'T TRUST** your memory!
* Cheap scales are not precise. Use extra caution. Likewise- kitchen measuring tools, cheap, student grade lab ware, eyedroppers- they are all less then 100% accurate. Err on the side of caution at all times.

It's me again. Still here I guess. Has anyone used 7oh after a short stint on zenes?,3,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1g7lkij/its_me_again_still_here_i_guess_has_anyone_used/,"I'm still alive if you can even call it that. I'm honestly not really happy about that but for reasons unknown to me my family is so I'm still giving myself a shot at life. 
Against all your advice I went ahead with the zenes excursion and it didn't kill me or anything but tbh I suspect that may be because the vendor cut it up a bunch to avoid some jackass like myself accidentally causing him to catch a manslaughter charge.  I can't even remember the measurements but a few sprays from a repurposed nasal spray bottle had me nice and relaxed.  I never even experienced any euphoria, most likely because I was too afraid of the stuff to try higher doses (and rightfully so). I did however get some of the best sleep I've ever had to the point where it was hard waking up in the morning. 
I'm not saying everyone who simply commented on my posts "" just don't do it"" were right to do so because as I already said before,  it was something I was going to do without a shadow of a doubt and it's very likely that the very few people who actually commented useful information about dosing and harm reduction saved my life. The other comments didn't help at all so even though I did come to the same conclusion on my own, I still do not condone people simply telling everyone to stay away because some of us simply aren't gonna listen to that shit. 
Moving on though.... now my question is simply this: has anyone who used these god awful zenes found any withdrawal relief from taking relevant doses of 7-oh ? As I said in my last post the zenes l was using were actually a combination of 3 different ones for a more ""full spectrum "" of effects.  The only one I'm fairly certain that was present was Protonitazene based off my memory from chatting up the vendor.  I have no idea what the other 2 were except that one of them was a ""pyne"" used to give it longer legs. 
Also worth noting is that I only used this stuff for about 5 days or so. All that being said, last night (about 7or 8 hrs after my last spray) I felt fine as I lay down to sleep however I couldn't actually sleep to Dave my life and when this morning came I was in the worst WD I have ever felt before.  I can't say it was much worse than the WD I've had from fent or H however the speed at which they took hold of me was remarkable to say the least. Normally I'd have to go cold turkey for a couple days from F or H while the WD slowly ramped up to get to this stage but this time it was almost instant.
Surprisingly enough the nausea hasn't really been an issue so far and that's most likely due to the 7oh I've been taking.  I have been gagging a little here and there but it's mostly just mental. The cold sweats and restlessness/agitation however have been all too real. I'm always a little suicidal but today Ive had to wrestle those thoughts much more than usual and I can safely say that if not for what it would do to those close to me I'd have killed myself by now 100%.  
Back to the 7oh, I really can't say enough how much of a godsend this stuff ha been in the past but from everything I've read I can't help but wonder if the relief I've been feeling is just in my head? I was under the impression that not even fent could help curb the WD one gets from zene usage but perhaps maybe the short length of time I spent using it has been a factor?
That's really what this post is mainly about.  I'm just wondering if anyone else has had any relief from using 7oh for the insane WD from this shit? I'm praying to my God and many more that someone here can honestly say that it does in fact help and this isn't just some temporary relief my mind has conjured up as it spirals into full blown insanity... 
I realize that 7oh WD are a thing also but surely it can't be as bad as it was this morning when I was thinking about begging the soul nearest to me to finally end my wretched existence?  Someone please help me get at least some hope for the possibility of making it out of this mess alive for my family's sake.",10/19/24 23:27,

Is it possible for zenes to show positive on the little dipstick tests used to test products for fentanyl?,4,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1g6jyg7/is_it_possible_for_zenes_to_show_positive_on_the/,"OK so I know this question might be hard to answer as there is some important information I am unable to provide at the moment, however I  am going to try and update with the missing info ASAP. 
Anyhow here goes... I recently started using a mixture of zenes I got from a vendor who seems to be held in high regards on multiple different platforms. 
I began using this stuff without any tolerance to zenes because I will have to start taking urine screens soon and I needed something that would not test positive for anything. I made a nasal spray from it and it's honestly been very underwhelming as far as effects go. I get very slight euphoria, a bit of relaxation,  and tons of drowsiness  which leads me to believe that there may be some tranq in it or something....either that or perhaps the vendor stepped on it a bunch to lessen the chances of some noob like myself overdosing. 
Anyhow,  I was told that it was a mixture of 3 different chems. I'm about 90% sure that Protonitazene was supposed to be one, either iso or meto was supposed to the the 2nd, and I believe they said the 3rd one was a ""pyne"" in order to lengthen the legs. 
As soon as I got it I dissolved a small chunck in about a shot glass of water (it did not totally dissolve at 1st, took some time) and then used a fent strip to see if there was any fent by accidental cross contamination or anything. The 1st one showed an EXTREMELY faint line indicating a negative result and the tests were expired so I decided to add in a little more of the powder ( which is sort of a dark Grey, gunpowder looking color btw) and tried another strip. 
The 2nd strip had no visible line at all, indicating a positive result for fent and I'm just hoping to get a little clarity on a couple things....
1. For starters are the tests used to determine if a product is cut with fent the same kind of strips used to test for fent in urine?  It's hard to find any concrete Info on this online as most of the search results are just  bringing up pages about harm reduction in general and not mentioning urine testing. 
2. If this stuff does indeed contain fent, should I not be getting more of a buzz? 
I am not after a buzz at this point,  I simply wanna be able to function for a little while longer until I can get my medication from my doctor which is taking a bit longer than expected.  
My 1st urine screen can happen at any time now and I  am considering just tossing the nasal spray and dealing with the pain/ WD that follows but I would hate to do so if this is not uncommon and the test strips I used are different from the kind used to detect drug abuse. 
If anyone can please help me make the right decision here I'll be eternally grateful. I just want to get my life back together but I also cannot afford to just lay down and cease functioning either.  I have no idea what to do and I need your help reddit 😥.",10/18/24 14:53,

I have been on and off opioids for 30 years due to chronic pain( 40 broken bones from mostly sports as well as many ST injuries. Over 12 significant surgeries)  I have come off of them at least 4x during this period.  The withdrawals have always been been bad.  I tried cold turkey , tapering, suboxeone.

Therefore I will most likely use a mix of 3 zenes I have lying around (which I forgot all the names of) which I originally had planned to use after my 7OH ran out so I wouldn't waste the 7OH... but since it's not working anyways I want to just use the zenes once to have a pleasant evening and will then take a break from all of it for awhile before returning to 7OH again. 
Therefore I just need to know how long on average it takes your tolerance to drop back down low enough to enjoy the other opis again after you stop using the zenes. I know it takes longer than it does after quitting anything else like H, F, etc... for obvious reasons but idk how that works with something as strong as zenes yet.
If anyone can give me even just some ballpark answers to this I will love you forever lol. Thanks for reading. ",10/12/24 19:09,
from f etonitazepyne to odsmt,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1g234lo/from_f_etonitazepyne_to_odsmt/,"
Hey guys, I've been vaping the fetonitazepyne 30mg/ml for about 2 weeks and yesterday about 20 hours ago it ran out and I haven't had any withdrawal worth mentioning yet, even though the potency is supposed to be 10-20 and it's quite a long time I'm a little surprised by this (I still had 30 mg of diazepam and weed at the start, but it's still strange that there are almost no symptoms apart from a bit of back pain. Well, in any case, my odsmt and my avizafone + rilmazolam arrived today because I really don't care about this shit anymore liquids simply have far too many side effects.. luckily they will be taken out of the shop from November..
In any case, my question now is: approximately how long do I have to wait after my last f etonitazepyne consumption until I feel something from around 50 mg of ODSMT? Does anyone have experience with that? Thanks in advance and have a nice weekend! ;)",10/12/24 15:52,

Some places 13 bag buns some 15 bag. Some 10 just all depends. But I got a bun of the same stamp I’ve been getting for the last 6 months and a bun of 15 will last me 5-6 days sometimes 4 if I’m off work and home all day because what’s self discipline is when your an addict right. But anyways yeah I’m doing half a bag to 3/4 a bag in a shot and I get a hot flash when I hit and then I wake up a hour later because of this stupid fucking tranq bs. So homeboy didn’t have any buns on him but he had some gel caps. Gel caps come exclusively from Baltimore that’s just how they sell their dope. So I get it and it’s white fluffy little chunky has that strong opiate taste I do a tiny little bit bc of having not tried them and I don’t feel shit. So I do a little more… nothing. Then finally I put a decent amount in the spoon and I hit and I get a slight rush for about 2 minutes and that’s it. Shits trash but it’s kept me from being sick for them last 3 days. Dissolves in water with no issue the water is almost clear maybe a slight yellow ish tint. What tf could it be ? It’s only my second time doing caps outta bmore because the one other time I did a tiny little bit and woke up face down on my bathroom floor 4 hours later in my own vomit and that was frightening. But any one had anything like this? And when it smokes on foil it looks just like fetty does but has a weird taste to it then the aftertaste is that strong opiate taste like you get when you get the drip from sniffin dope.

What's the best bottom use for making zene nasal sprays?,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1g1kdqz/whats_the_best_bottom_use_for_making_zene_nasal/,"I'm not sure if some of them have the ability to spray controlled amounts or not but if so that would be amazing.  Also I'm struggling to find a generic nasal spray bottle at the local dollar store that can hold more than 30ml so a larger size would be really nice and tbh downright necessary for my usage scenarios. 
So, what do you fine folks like to use?
Ohhhh and should I go ahead and scoop up a small bottle of ever clear in case some of the zenes I have ( I have 3 different types but I can't remember their names and the bags are not labeled) wont dissolve in water?  I know,  Lotta extra risk there but that's why I'm going to start with a heavily diluted mix and take it extremely slow. But yeah though, size is my main concern as I need to fit as much as I can into one bottle. 
Would it be possible to just toss like a half gram into a glass dropper  bottle with as much everclear as it takes to dissolve it / as much as possible and make it so it's measured out enough already that I can just put a dropper or two inside the nasal spray bottle and add enough water to it to get it back to my chosen ratio? Sorry,  I'm really bad with math ( English guy here) and I'm  dead set on doing this but I don't wanna fuck up and kill myself if it can easily be avoided with some advice from the experts.

I'm going on a vacation with my family for about 2-3 weeks and I have a few questions.  For starters how much of the gram I have is enough to last this long ?
Second,  I I originally wanted to fill up a ceramic vape cart with some Z juice but I read that it was too dangerous because of overheating coils and coil buildup and was told that a nasal spray was a much safer option so I'm going with that I suppose.  However I've also read on here that zenes are often not water soluble at all so I'm wondering how they are making nasal spray with those ones... just by using PG/VG vape juice or ethanol instead? 
Finally I will have to be as discreet as possible about this but I saw that people are only mixing up to about 30mg per ml tops for their nasal spray and mix up new batches along and along but I won't have anywhere to hide a big ass bottle of solution anyways so is there any way I can mix up a whole gram( or less depending on how much is needed for the entire trip) into one nasal spray bottle and only use minute amounts somehow?

Jumping off methadone with SR-17018,23,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1fzjfsp/jumping_off_methadone_with_sr17018/,"Adding to the anecdotal reports, I’m jumping off 100mg methadone using SR-17018. First day without; WDs started, took 25mg SR and feeling better. 
I’ll add to this post as I go so that the body of knowledge is out there for others ready to get the monkey off their back. Here goes 
Edit: another 12 hours in. Still feeling fine from my first 25mg dose
Day 2: Didn’t have to dose again until symptoms started creeping in at t+20 from the first dose. Another 25mg. It didn’t seem to provide the same relief as yesterday so after 90 minutes I added another 18mg. Now comfortable for the most part. Wasn’t feeling awful, just yawning and temperature disregulation. Added 4mg nitrazolam as a comfort med. feeling well now, considering I jumped from 100mg methadone
Day 3: I grabbed a couple grams of ketamine to help dissociate and be mentally checked out, ngl; also to promote neuroplasticity because I know my brain is all sorts of fucked up trying to renormalize. The day has been a blur. I dosed 30mg SR after another 20 hours and I’m free from opioid WD. Still relying on a little nitrazolam for comfort and rest. I’m doing well, considering having jumped from 100mg methadone (I should be begging for death under normal circumstances). Increased my SR to every 12 hours
Day 5?: I think I’ve turned the corner. Other than having to dissociate myself for 24 hours, this was miraculous. To jump off 100mg methadone (plus 400-500mg methiodone)! Whoever owns the patent on this….oh man. And I cannot send my thanks enough to the Chinese lab folks who instead of doing the usual and churning out shit like zenes and benzos that cause dependency and death decided to release this Nobel worthy invention. I’m dumbfounded. 
Day 6: completely symptom free. Just cravings to occupy my time and sleeping less than I was before. Continuing to decrease my SR dose, no more symptoms creeping in at the 12 hour mark; currently taking 18mg every 12 hours. I almost feel like I could just discontinue, but I’m gonna go a few more days. I’ll also begin spacing my doses further apart. Still using nitrazolam to aid sleep, but I’m setting a hard line for discontinuing that in 3 days. 
My updates will probably come less frequently now that I feel I’m out of the fire. My plan is to continue decreasing my SR dose and discontinue completely by next weekend (day 11). If I experience any symptoms upon cessation I’ll continue a few more days and try again. The following weekend I’ll test my tolerance with something weak and report effects on that facet of the experience.

I have a G of proton and am thinking of cutting it half way with iso for this but I plan to vape a vape juice with about 1/4th of this G, or 250mg dissolved I to vape juice and I'm not sure how much vape juice I should add?
Also, just gonna go out on a limb here and assume that getting this stuff on my bare skin would mean very certain death so I'm going to make sure I wear something like a T shirt or mask over my face, gloves on my hands and anything else that comes to mind but I will NOT let this stuff on my skin to say the least.  
A magnetic hot stirrer would be ideal but unfortunately a double boil and shaking will have to suffice because I don't have the funds for that right now or a MG scale. That's right,  I don't have a MG scale Therefore the solution should probably be less concentrated than normal to help make up for the possibility of a few extra mgs, and I'll be relying heavily on the volumetrically dosed solution aspect in order to make sure I don't dose too high. 
I'm most likely going to use a regular grams scale to cut the G into a roughly with emphasis on roughly estimated quarter gram and then start by dumping that into a small jar. From there I'll add ever how much nic free vape juice, give it a quick stir, and cap it. The rest of this is pretty self explanatory but if you can think of any simple ways to increase my survival rate please let me know.
If you made it this far and still plan to comment saying simply "" don't do it"" , then I will remind you that I am bent and determined that I will have a good time with this stuff soon or I'll die trying,  no two ways about it. It's work the risk of death to me. Calk me crazy if you want it's cool,  just please don't do it on this one particular post lol.",10/7/24 7:20,
How to dose SR17018? (Not for Humans of course but if you are desperate...),21,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1fxib3h/how_to_dose_sr17018_not_for_humans_of_course_but/,"Disclaimer:
I won’t respond to anyone asking where to find SR-17018. It's not difficult—just search around forums, and you'll figure it out. Think of the ""big Asian friend"" to help guide you.
Introduction to SR-17018, My Experience, and Conclusions
SR-17018 is a G-protein-biased μ-opioid receptor agonist, avoiding β-arrestin2 activation. It reduces tolerance and respiratory depression, making withdrawal faster and less painful. In my case, it completely stopped cravings and lowered my tolerance quickly, turning the detox process into a smooth, nearly effortless experience.
---
SR-17018: How to Dose It?
Dose for humans = (Dose for primates × Human weight in kg) ÷ 3.1
For an 80 kg person with a primate dose of 0.2 mg/kg:
Human dose = (0.2 mg/kg × 80 kg) ÷ 3.1
Human dose ≈ 5.16 mg per administration.
If taken every 6 hours, the total daily dose is 20.64 mg per 24 hours.
Conclusion
SR-17018 significantly reduces cravings and tolerance, providing a quicker and less painful detox than traditional opioid treatments, making recovery smooth and manageable.

I’m currently on day 9 (still strong) of detox with SR-17018, and while the process has been going well overall (no cravings or withdrawal symptoms), I’m experiencing something interesting but also a bit overwhelming: the return of emotions and a heightened sense of smell.
It’s been a while since I felt this connected to my body and emotions—sometimes it feels like I’m rediscovering what it means to be alive. It’s intense, especially with music, which can bring up a lot of emotions I thought I’d forgotten. However, the most uncomfortable part is the heightened sense of smell. I’m very sensitive to odors right now, and it can be a bit distracting, though not unbearable.
I’m wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar? How did you manage the sensory overload, especially with the sense of smell? I’ve been considering using a nasal spray (like oxymetazoline or something similar) to help with the nasal sensitivity. Has anyone tried this, or have other tips that helped during this phase of recovery?

I avoid addiction and physical dependence by doing it like this, and it makes my tolerance reset for the next binge. I’ve never touched fentanyl or zenez
Anyway, my question is when used opioids like oxycodone or heroin or even fentanyl/zenes are used in addition with SR-17018, at a dosage that you would use to ‘feel good’ (and not detox) do you still feel the full effects of the normal opioid high? If the normal euphoria affects are felt, and tolerance is being prevented from being raised (or maybe even lowered), then would this not mean an opioid naive individual could take like 30mg oxy + SR everyday and never get a physician addiction while still getting recreational effects?
As far as I understand, if all of this is true then this could be a massive medical breakthrough for recreation/medical, and effectively removes all the negatives and risks associated with opioid use. You could prescribe someone an opioid with a little SR combined in it (or take recreationally), and they would get pain relief/euphoria everyday for the rest of their lives without gaining a dependance or having to raise the dose.

HunteR's tales Vol. 001 - Scene overview & SPC Deep-Dive: A complicated chemical with a complexed complex (aka how to increase potency),13,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1frc57p/hunters_tales_vol_001_scene_overview_spc_deepdive/,"**Intro & overview / preview on current RCs Opioid scene (part 1)**
It was about time.   
  
Apologize for the possible typos and such, I have - as usual - no time, in the last year I sleep 0-3h/night and lately I even stopped to use the bed to sleep. Yeah I know it's not healthy. Yeah I know I have to fix my lifestyle. I'm on it trust me ;) But this is not about me, but to my new series of small essays I will publish with tremendous IRREGULAR schedule.
Anyone not knowing me, I am the former founder of this sub - Actually I opened it not much time after I started doing opioids, and I did it totally randomly, by noticing how much criticized were the RC Opioid Users when asking on other subs. And because I hoped somehow to make some new connections to find again my beloved Furanyl-F. I do not have any chemistry nor pharmacology skills - I am just a psychonaut since over 30 years, with almost 3'000 compounds tried. So my knowledge is mostly empirical. After many months, and by connecting with more and more people - not for business but because fascinated from all the hundreds of opioids I had no idea they exist / were existing, this sub grew up in an impressive way, it was an amazing mix of opioid-centric discussion where opioids users, harm prevention helpers, and several pharmacologists and chemists were discussing about a wide range of topic! So it became too late to ""jump out"", and I ended up being deeply in the RC opioid scene because it's a passion I just cannot give up.  
  
I always gave my best to help the scene, I never had interests in using my network to make money or to promote whoever for financial interests or favoritisms- all I did and I do for the scene is for the well being for the scene first! And of course for my own well being, because I'm a proud opioid addicted. Now that Zenes are leaving the scene, finally people are finding back their sin, and more interesting topics are starting to surface. There will be a lot more to discuss especially in 2025. So I decided I will give my contributions to the scene, to take ""as is"" since I do not have all the skills on pharma & chemistry, but I definitely have a lot of experience in researching in an objective way new RCs.
After a month of researching **SPC**, I own to the users who are helping keeping this community in a good shape, some intel that is time finally to reveal, after all my not-really-scientific but empiric research and experiments with this chemical.
I stressed the die-hard Zenes fans to start tapering already 3 months a go, knowing what was going on in the underground chemistry & unreleased - exactly because it's the natural path of destiny that Zenes should now leave the scene. After 4 years of Zenes only it's about time.
**Intro & overview / preview on current RCs Opioid scene (part 2)**
The release of **SR-17018** came as a bless, and probably as apology for having spread so much dead (initially) and saved so many lives at the same time, or USA would have been doomed from the mexican cartels craps. At least, the online scene - in the streets, where the majority of the opiod addocted are buying from, there is not much that can be done. Only the gov. tries to apply solutions, and every time it became more a mess.   
At the same time, the bless of SR-17018 is a curse too, because people not believing how the tolerance get drastically reduced in such a short time, especially from a class like Zenes where the natural tolerance restoration takes months otherwise with several struggles - lost their lives by dosing their Zenes or other strong opioids after a tapering / replacing with SR- for just a few weeks. By taking ""only"" the half of the amount they used before. Some of them were true heroes who spent years of their private time in helping me and other members with a proper masterplan to push the stalled scene doing a U-turn and trying to go back from where we came, where its not the analgesic potency what really matters, but the proper classes with amazing receptors affinity giving all the best effects several people even forgot after such a long time with Zenes.
Only the criminals doing fake pressed pills and synthetic heroin benefits of insane stupid potencies with compounds having a very poor efficiency, for the potency they have - compounds that on a recreational or therapeutic way are laughable compared to the glorious fentalogues golden age pre-2019, and other RCs that came before them.
So I stressed to start reducing the tolerance, with proper care and tempo, in sight of the newcomers compounds that aim to bring back a pleasant, warm, euphoric vibe and physical well being - other than helping the chronic pain users to get something stronger than O-DSMT for pain management. 
For years, we saw only RCs of max 1-2x morphine potency, then a huge gap, and then the first Zenes (meto) with his 70x'ish morphine potency (I do not count Flunitazene because it's utterly trash). This gap must be filled because it's the perfect balance in the way low-potency opioid users can enjoy them without risking ug dosages, and strong-potency users can benefits the same just with an higher dosage. And criminals interested only if minting money by cutting and selling with zero transparency, won't be able to do the same anymore, moving hopefully to other business and allowing the scene to born again, with a public of smart users and pharmacologists/Chemists back to discuss the possible new classes.
Janssen needs no presentations, the creator of opioids like dextromoramide and Fentanyl changed the medicine and the pain management therapies permanently, allowing to severe chronic pain people to have a normal life. All the precious notes he left of other opioids only on paper or developed / tested only to a very close number of individuals, but mostly on rats, contains so many holy grails.
I was very excited when I discovered that one of his compound was being synthesized, because I had the occasion to try it in the underground RCs opioid scene more than 2 years ago. But, once again, the Zenes trendy fucked up the whole. The dextromoraide analogue, that could have been one of the best RCs ever seen, turned into a total flop because it was not at all made the analogue that was suggested, due technical issues - but the weakest analogue, barely 1/16th morphine  potency. For sure he was screaming inside his tomb -\_-  
The same - well, not really so catastrophic - repeated again. The dire needs of potency or thinking ""the stronger the better"" stroked again, and another analogue of this class, not the same I tried was made.

SR-17018: The Key to Ending Opioid Cravings?,41,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1fravfb/sr17018_the_key_to_ending_opioid_cravings/,"Hello everyone,
I’m on day 19 (ongoing) of my detox after a year of daily use of incredibly strong Zenes like Protonitazepyne, Isotonitazepyne, Cyclorphyne, and Spiro***rphine. I was in deep, taking high doses every single day.
Right now, I’m using 100 mg of SR-17018 a day, split into two doses. Let me tell you something: I have ZERO cravings. Yes, absolutely ZERO desire to use any opioids, which is just unbelievable to me. I’ve been dependent on opioids for 20 years, and I have never experienced anything like this. Usually, the cravings hit hard, but this time, there's nothing. The withdrawal symptoms? Almost ZERO – just mild symptoms. It’s incredible.
The only downside I’ve noticed is a heavy head and some confusion. But by day 5, after getting some rest, it’s starting to improve. I think my body and brain are finally adapting to SR-17018.
EDIT: To clarify, I have all the substances available right now. If I wanted to, I could literally take two steps and be back using. But the thing is, I do not want to do it. It feels ridiculous to even consider, which is mind-blowing because I’ve tried everything: methadone, Suboxone, Catapresan, cold turkey... SR-17018 is the only thing that has worked like this.
I’ve been through countless detox attempts, both at home and in controlled environments, and nothing compares to this. I used to suffer from agonizing withdrawals and intense cravings, but now I feel... normal. It’s not just that SR suppresses the cravings; the urge to use has completely vanished. It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
SR-17018 could be a breakthrough that changes how we handle opioid addiction and withdrawal. This could potentially save millions of lives.
---
Dosage Comparison (SR-17018 vs. Animal Studies)
For those interested in the technical side, I’ve looked into the dosages used in animal studies. In primates, doses of 0.1–1 mg/kg were used, which translates to about 100-180 mg per day for a human weighing 100 kg. This closely matches the 100 mg I’m taking daily, which is proving to be very effective. In rats, doses range from 0.3 to 3 mg/kg, and SR-17018 shows promise at these levels for opioid withdrawal without intense cravings.
The balance between effectiveness and avoiding side effects, like the heavy-headedness I mentioned earlier, seems important. The fact that SR-17018 can provide relief without causing euphoria or dependence is groundbreaking.
---
In conclusion, SR-17018 should be seriously looked into for its potential to end opioid cravings and eliminate withdrawal symptoms. From my experience, it’s far superior to treatments like methadone or Suboxone, and I believe it could be key to a future without opioid addiction.

It's a derivative of mitragynine, the main alkaloid in kratom leaves, and is intended to be a low-potency partial mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist. 
----------
From the Atai Lifesciences website. They are currently going through clinical trials of KUR-101. According to their stock price phase one trials. Since they are ""Lil Pharms"" compared to the evil Big Pharma, I'm somewhat interested in buying up some of their stock but instead all my money is going to 7-hydroxymitragynine and Pseudoindoxyl when it's been in stock. If you haven't tried pseudoindoxyl it's like 7oh but slightly less ""euphoric"" and more sedative. I gotta put euphoric in quotes when talking about kratom products. It's a sense of wellness as opposed to sickness. If there were some semi synthetics the Chinese cooks started mixing in kratom with their  szeuchwan sauce  for something stronger, maybe minus the antagonists and such I would want that stuff.

Right now I'm at a crossroads with my path. 7oh is too pricey so I'm going back to mit based extracts but also did a dose of poppy tea yesterday. Afterwards did some planting as my last plants all expired.

Regarding the recent post on a Xylazine removal tek,13,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1fln74s/regarding_the_recent_post_on_a_xylazine_removal/,"Here is one that was recently posted on our 🌰 equivalent that gained some popularity. 
**THIS METHOD WAS NOT CREATED BY ME. I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS.**
I felt like now was a good enough time as any to post this, this shit is pretty dangerous. This isn't a very refined post or technique like some of my guides, and I haven't had the time to run a lot of experiments to try and optimize the conditions or solvents. This isn't meant to be a really in-depth guide for now, it's meant to be a quick way to teach people the concept and be as accessible to as many people as possible and as simple as possible.
Disclaimer: Adding this section in just because I think some people have read this and gotten the wrong idea. This is analogous to just doing a simple filtration, evaporating the filtrate, and then repeating multiple times. I'm aware Xylazine is not insoluble in alcohols. This won't totally remove all the Xylazine, I was a little bit overzealous with the title which should probably have read a tek for removing ""some"" of it from your dope, however it will completely remove many of the other cuts and will significantly improve the quality of your dope, making it much more usable afterwards.
Xylazine is a weak base that reacts with acids to form salts, just like heroin or fentanyl. It's usually present as the hydrochloride,
Things you will need at bare minimum:
- Shitty xylazine dope
- Methanol (buy online)
- Acetone (buy online or at the hardware store, get something like klean strip that doesn't have additives)
- Some glass cups / flasks / beakers
- A glass oven-safe tray or dish
- Blow dryer / heat gun / fan
- Some kind of filtration mechanism. Read below to see what fits your situation. I always recommend the pipette and hand pumps to people. They're like a $30 investment and very worth it.
- Oven
Here's a quick run-down of the concept and a summary of the technique. Whatever drug you're partaking in is likely a hydrochloride salt. Maybe it's heroin hydrochloride, or maybe it's something stronger like one of the china white F# blends. These are pretty soluble in methanol. Xylazine hydrochloride is not all that soluble in methanol [or at least less so than the desired compounds]. This means if you crush up your dope really well and then add methanol to it, the dope will dissolve while a good portion of the Xylazine will not.
Summary of procedure so far: grind dope, add methanol. No more than 3 mL per gram.
FILTERING
Now you need to pass the resulting solution through a filter. This can be a lot of different things, at the most ghetto level, secure a coffee filter to a cup with a rubber band, make sure it has enough slack to where it droops down in the center to hold the solids and liquid. Pour the solution onto this and let it drain through. Save this liquid.
Some of you might be wondering if you can draw it up through a cotton the way you might filter a shot if you aren't using a syringe filter. This is actually the right kind of idea but methanol and most solvents will destroy the rubber plunger and plastic syringe too quickly. The cotton can also get clogged up with solids very quickly depending on how much of your dope is xylazine and other cuts.
One alternative is to invest in a glass syringe with a blunt tip needle that you can use exclusively for this purpose. Around 5 to 10mL would be a decent size. You can use this and just drop a new cotton ball in when the first one gets clogged.
Another, better method to using a glass syringe is to use a 10mL glass pipette and a pipette hand pump. Look on ebay/amazon for these they sell kits with 3. A larger hand pump will create more of a vacuum.
It works like a big syringe, you attach the pipette to the hand pump, push the tip into the cotton, and pull the plunger back to draw up liquid. Then you lightly tap the release button a few times to make sure you don't pull up the cotton when you with draw the whole thing.
At the most advanced level, use a buchner funnel and filter flask with 6-10 micron filter paper and some kind of vacuum source. You can just buy a full buchner vacuum filtration kit with funnel, flask, clamp, and hand pump included, or you can rig something up yourself.
Each time you do this, we'll call it a ""pull"". Whichever method you choose, you will want to add a little more methanol. Use half as much as the first time and then do the filtration again. Add this with the first liquid. Usually 3 pulls in total will do the trick.
Once you have your filtered liquid, unless it looks completely pristine, you should pass the liquid through your filtration method one more time, don't add more methanol, just filter the solution to remove any remaining solids. Use a fresh cotton/filter/etc don't pour your filtered solution back through the old solids or anything like that.
DRYING
Now pour this onto a glass, oven-safe tray. The more surface area the better. Shoot it with a blowdryer or heat gun to start evaporating it. For the fastest evaporation, try to hit it and work the air stream in such a way that it moves the liquid around in a circular pattern. If you can do this outside or on a patio that's ideal, if not just be mindful that methanol is flammable. Don't be stupid and turn the heat gun up to 1000 degrees and stick it right in the methanol and light yourself on fire. Just be reasonable and keep the heating element at a safe distance whatever you use and be mindful of how much vapor is accumulating around you if you aren't in a well ventilated space. If you aren't sure of yourself just use a fan and check back every hour or so.
Keep doing this until when you grab the tray and move it back and forth there is no liquid sloshing around.
[If you do this with a product that doesn't contain xylazine at all you can end up with a dry product right after evaporating the methanol. This will usually be pretty pure so be careful. Mind the weight before and after, if you end up with half the amount you started with it's probably 2x as strong. You can figure out the multiplier by dividing the starting weight by the end weight.]
SHITTY WET OIL >>> DRY SOLID
At this point you will most likely think you have failed and produced nothing but a bunch of wet/oily clear shit. This is because the product has oiled out, [here specifically this happens from it having a high water content. Xylazine HCl pulls in water aggressively and can form multiple different hydrates, so the more that's in your stuff the more of an issue the moisture is]. At this point the acetone comes in. Pour a little bit onto the tray and repeat the evaporation step. You're going to keep doing this acetone splashing and evaporating step until you start to see the white of a solid precipitating out. Think of the acetone as helping dry out the product.
If you have some kind of metal tool like what you might use to scoop your drugs / wax concentrate (or a spoon/butter knife) scraping the bottom of the tray to help mechanically agitate the solid can help speed up this last part.
When you don't see any more white appearing, as in when it seems to have all precipitated out, evaporate any remaining liquid until once again you can't slosh it around, this time you should have a damp solid. Now stick it in the oven at around 230F. Let it sit in there, checking on it every 8 minutes or so until it's dry enough to scrape with a razor and get a powder. Take it out and scrape it up. Unless you live in the desert or some shit you'll need to put this in some kind of jar or vial because it's pretty hygroscopic. If you just leave it on the plate or in a bag outside it will clump up.
If this clumping happens you'll have to put it in a shotglass or cup, pour acetone on it, crush it around with some tool and then pour it on the tray and dry it in the oven again.
These are also the same steps you should take if you heated/scraped it too early and it's still gooey.
And there you have it, I know there was a lot of details missing from this but this should give you a start. I've only had a chance to try this with methanol and anhydrous ethanol and the methanol worked better.
IMPORTANT NOTE: This also removes a lot of the polyhydric alcohol cuts like mannitol so be careful! You'll end up with a much stronger product. I'm repeating a similar note from earlier but pay attention to how much weight you've lost. This doesn't remove all the xylazine so if you end up with half the amount you started assume it's probably 2x as strong. You can figure out the multiplier by dividing the starting weight by the end weight. In reality the potency will be less than this but just for safety purposes use this as a starting estimation.
Hope this helps some people out there.
QUICK UPDATE:
I repeated this procedure again recently using a freshly opened bottle of anhydrous ethanol and found I was able to get the best results so far. I used a freshly opened bottle so it was very dry. If you're comfortable with drying solvent with 3A molecular sieve then know you can get better results by drying either alcohol with it first (sit overnight and then filter, decant, or distill before use). They absorb around 20% their weight when freshly regenerated.
My runner up recommendation as a desiccant (for the methanol) would be Magnesium Sulfate that's been made anhydrous by heating at 200C/392F. Let it cool down and then add it to the the methanol to a container that's sealed from air, agitate well and then filter after 30 minutes or so.
NEWEST ADDITION: Solubility data of possible candidate solvents
Unfortunately the solubilities change with the polymorphs of the xylazine hydrochloride. The anhydrous form and the hydrate are going to be the only ones I focus on.
%% Estimated Solubilities %%
Fentanyl Hydrlochloride
chloroform: 5mg/mL
dichloromethane: 6mg/mL
2-propanol: 10mg/mL
Xylazine HCl - Anhydrous form
chloroform: 2.5mg/mL
dichloromethane: 4.6mg/mL
2-propanol: 2mg/mL
Xylazine HCl - Hydrate
chloroform: 1.0mg/mL
dichloromethane: 2.3mg/mL
2-propanol: 0.8mg/mL
Note: I couldn't find anything for Heroin HCl, and the following values should be assumed computational unless a source is located for each one:
Separation will be maximized if the Xyl-HCl is allowed to form the main hydrate, then something like 99% or dry isopropyl alcohol is used.
To do this, take the mix or even a thoroughly dried product you obtained if you did this thread's parent procedure with something like methanol. Grind it in a mortar and pestle with a few drop of distilled water. Just enough to make a paste consistency. Spread this onto a glass tray then use a few drops to rinse the mortar an pour that on it to get everything. Spread onto a plate let air dry for a few days. At this point the Xylazine HCl should exist almost entirely as it's hydrate form.
Complete the procedure at this point using the isopropanol.
Isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol / 2-propanol) may be the ideal solvent. It makes sense. I got better performance with anhydrous ethanol than methanol, and of all the solvent comparisons, it is the most promising in terms of what it looks like on paper.

ODSMT losing magic,3,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1fll67p/odsmt_losing_magic/,Ive been on odsmt for over a year now and the magic is basically all gone no matter how much I take. I mean most the magic was gone after a few months but if I triple dosed or somthing id still be really happy but its getting to the point where I go from hating my life when withdrawling to about 10 minutes of a good buzz and then I redose every 2 hours.  Im quitting all drugs in several months so im not trying to spend the last of my time buzzing trying to taper down just to quit soon after. What can I do to get this magic back so I can enjoy my last few months of use. Im willing to do somthing stronger if needed but all I have acesss to is odsmt right now,9/20/24 20:03,

Let's Flip the Xylazine Conversation and Remember Who We Are,23,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1fkifc2/lets_flip_the_xylazine_conversation_and_remember/,"I just realized that there are threads everyday about ""fuck xylazine"" ""why is there tranq  in all the dope"". Well. Here's the answer: 
~~The CIA~~
I don't know. But it is. It's in almost all of the fent and it's only getting worse.
We're taking it like a bish. This is not some ""stop buying it and the dealers will have to"" thing at all. The dealers legitimately *can not* find down without xylazene. And no one is going to tranq and fet withdrawal in protest lololol.
Guys we forgot who the fuck we are here for a minute. We are junkies who are online. We've done more research than then people prescribe the shit. Like... by a lot. We're obsessed with this thing, and a lot of us are also very intelligent. Plus we have all of our own experiences and tricks that we've all been sharing for years. And finally, we're down to be our own guinea pigs at the drop of a hat. Because that's our life already (lolol)... and the result is incredible.
What happens when a new ""non abusable"" pill of oxycodone or hydromorphone or whatever comes down the pike? It usually takes this  community between 12 hours and like 4 days before we've hobbled together some dopefiend kitchen chemistry and solved the problem. 
How many -- ""soak the pill in lemon juice, microwave for 8 seconds, put that goop into the freezer on a plate, then scrape it up with a razor, mix it into rubbing alcohol and water at a in a 1/20 solution, then burn off the alcohol, wheel filter and you're good as gold"" -- solutions have we figured out? I mean dozens if not hundreds by now.
Why the ***Fuck*** are we not treating xylazene like it's a new gelling agent in a our favorite opiate pill? What is the burning point? Freezing temp? Solubility in different liquids, pH, etc., etc.??
Let's stop bitching about 'who put the tranq into all the down??' or 'why would someone do this to us??' fuck that.

I have acquired two grams of SR-17018 and could also obtain more. I hope to find people here, who can tell me first-hand how they went about tapering off with the help of this substance. At the moment I consume around 0.3 g of IC-26 (methiodone) throughout the day and occasionally F-etonitazepyne or heroin or oxycodone, but then I leave out the IC-26. I am a little scared of SR-17018 because I have also read that it has an antagonistic effect and can cause withdrawal like naloxone/naltrexone. I hope there is someone here who has had experience with SR-17018 and can report how they used it to lower their tolerance to opioids. Did you take SR-17018 in addition to the other opioids? What dosage did you start with? What tips do you have for me on how I can use the substance? Should I wait until withdrawal symptoms appear or should I slowly increase the dosage while I reduce the dosage of the other opioids? I hope there are people here who can give me some advice.

Made a nasal spray of protonitazene and after heating it to mix it in saline it keeps on precipitating?,2,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1fhl2w7/made_a_nasal_spray_of_protonitazene_and_after/,"Hey just bought a gram or two of straight protonitazene (If memory serves me right could have been isonitazene) and as recommended by others on this sub i made a nasal spray to use it safely. I mixed around 140mg into 10ml of saline solution and shaked it up but when that didnt work to get it mixed i tried other steps. First i added a bit of isopropyl alcohol and shaked it some more but thats also didnt work. Then after i gave it a hot water bath; i heated up a small amount of water in a Tupperware bowl till it was boiling waited a bit then set my vial inside of it. 
Very quickly i was able to shake it to get my solution to dissolve it inside of it, i repeated that a few more time until it was fully dissolved. After the initial hot water bath i had some almost glass like shard looking precipitates in my nasal spray vial but; after another hot water bath and shaking it was perfectly done. I was able to use it for a bit with good amount of success but after a bit the precipitates came back in my solution. So i repeated the hot water bath and shaking and it was all good again. Then after using it some more the precipitates came back, so i repeated the hot water bath and shaking and was back to normal. The strength was fine and got me feeling good but again after a while the precipitates came back. 
Am i doing something wrong in this process? How can i prevent the precipitates from reappearing over and over again? Ive tried using cooler water and shaking it but it still comes back after a hour or 2. I find it weird because the potentcy has been fine so far. i used a small amount of product in the nasal spray so i have to take a good couple hits off of it to start feeling anything. but after that everything hits fine and feels good up until the preciptates come back and clogs up the nasal spray's tube that sucks up the solution.
So TLDR: how come my nasal spray keeps on having precipitates reappear after i already cleared them multiple times. Im following the solvent part of the volumetric dosing guide on the psychonaut wiki for my reference on what to do on this process.

MegaThread: ISOTONITAZEPYNE | Come share your experiences!,21,120,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1eu3iu8/megathread_isotonitazepyne_come_share_your/,"Got my order in today.
Please use this thread for general discussion and as a place to share your experiences with it. It will remain as a stickied megathread for visibility. Hopefully having megathreads of the currently available substances will condense all experiences into one place, in turn making it easier for people trying to find information on whatever substances are currently available and available all in 1 place.
My hope for these megathreads is to eventually include **DOSE RANGES** like psychonaut wiki does, **MME** trying to place a guesstimated Morphine Milligram Equivalency (and also convert that MME into a fentanyl comparison too), and **COMMON ADVERSE EVENTS** if there are any. And I don't mean like an overdose, I mean like if the new opioid happens to have a high KOR affinity and produces dysphoric/dissociative feelings, if it causes myoclonus events, any negative effects specific to ROA like severe thick phlegm making it hard to swallow if you vape, injection site damage even from a clean shot (not missing anything) if you're an IV user, or nasal problems if it causes any like stuffy nose or scabbing or an extreme burn upon insufflation (2MAP, 2CB, aPiHP, MDMA, Meth are all great examples of an extreme burn)
Anyhow, sorry for the 3f-pihp fueled edits and onto the experience report.
**Tolerance: 115mg methadone daily | 6' 200lb | used for a decade, at worst was doing 3x 100mg IV/day of etonitazepyne'**
T-2min: opening the baggie and giving it a sniff and I instantly recognized the signature smell that etonitazepyne used to have. A slightly sour-ish smell. Wonder if that's from the pyrrolidine? I haven't had protonitazepyne or metonitazepyne\* so I cannot say if they, too, have the sourish smell.
T+/-0min: \~5mg (eyeballed) vaped off foil: Instant headrush and warmth through my body, got the punch in the chest that used to happen when I would shoot good street dope, but sadly the euphoria only lasted like 10 minutes. Maybe I'm not dosing enough but opioids almost never have lasting euphoria for me anymore. They just fade into a near non-existent feeling in the back of my head and sometimes I'll get a hot flash.
T+60min: \~7-10mg (eyeballed) vaped off foil: Same effects as above but lingered a bit longer this time, about 15 mins.
So far I have no estimations on potency other than that it is significantly more potent than spirochlorphine lmao.

**INFO FROM DUCHESS' ""DOIHKAL"" POST SUGGEST THIS IS ""2x potency of fentanyl"" so that is the potency I am assuming while I choose my doses.**
I just received my pack and went at it. The taste on exhale can only be described as ""the smell of a tire shop"" or ""garden section of a hardware store"". While not an entirely pleasant taste, it certainly is manageable compared to the taste of something like metonitazepyne or protonitazene.
The consistency is a very fine white powder, almost like flour. There are tiny clumps of powder when scooped onto foil.
**Tolerance:** 115mg methadone daily | 6' 200lb | been on opioids for a decade and at my worst was doing 3x 100mg IV doses of etonitazepyne/day

T+10minVaped 10mg: Light efffects, body feeling slightly lighter and that opioid spacey head feeling.
T+20min Vaped another \~20mg: More pronounced opioid feeling you get in your head. Starting to feel waves of euphoria in my body but they're very subtle.
T+50min: vaped \~20mg in a single hit: Strong head rush followed by a pulse of warmth through my body. Gonna go shower and do some more testing.
T+90min vaped \~40mg in a single hit: Same as before but slightly stronger. Only lasts about 2-3 mins before it fades into subtlety.
T+120min 0mg spirochlorphine, \~5mg isotonitazepyne: I decided to stop burning through the gram of SPC for now and start tomorrow off with a 80mg dose vaporized off foil.
The isopyne gave an intense rush and amazing warmth for being a benzimidazole. I'll go make a mega thread for isotonitazepyne and share my experience more in detail there.
Also want to say, once more people begin their research and start sharing their trip reports in the comments of this thread, I will edit this post with the recommended dose ranges of SPC. The dose ranges will assume the user has no tolerance; as if they never took an opioid before.
Will update thread with more info as I do my testing. Anyone else with experiences can share them in the comments! Please include your tolerance, any substances/doses you take daily, RoA and dose, and if you're comfortable your height/weight.

Hi. First and foremost, don't be sarcastic or unnecessarily rude to me when I write this post.
But a friend and I have been using heroin sporadically for quite a few years, and a friend of mine managed to get hold of a bottle of Protonitazene.
The bottle is supposed to be 45mg/5ml.
I know this is dangerous territory, and that's why I'm asking you good people how to use this 'safely,' if you can even call it that.
I've been searching the internet for what might be a reasonable minimal dose without reaching the danger zone, but I can hardly find anything. Is there anyone here who has experience with nitazenes who can give me some advice regarding dosage? It's a dropper bottle.
There's no point in commenting that he should just throw the bottle away because I know him well enough to know that wouldn't happen. So please, give some input on how this can be used without ending up in a coffin after just one use. We're almost talking about life and death here. It’s supposed to be xx times stronger than Fentanyl.

Nitazene compounds become metabolised in the liver by CYP450  to N-desethylated derivatives, which are more potent and long lasting than the parent nitazines themselves. 
This means that if you're an IV user, the initial rush and intensity of effects will NOT be the peak intensity of the experience, rather the peak intensity will be delayed as the drug takes time to go through your liver.

If you mods require additional Mod permissions and overall have ideas about what direction the sub should take. Please have civil discussions about it. Please keep in mind Full permissions for a mod means full permissions and only few should have those and for a good reason.
Once Rengar has the active status again, he can edit said mod permissions for everyone listed below him and move this sub in a direction you all should have some agreement on. If he ever becomes inactive without handing the full permissions to anyone else, please only then hit up me or Hunter.

IV Protonitazene technique,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1ell9qx/iv_protonitazene_technique/,"I need some guidance on using this drug intravenously. It is not the most soluble in water. Applying heat will increase solubility, as it does, but then when temperature drops, the drug precipitates out of solution. It has been advised to use reconstitution solution with benzyl alcohol, and I have some on the way and will try this out. Even moving quickly to avoid precipitation, when injecting over 20 ㎎, the pressure from the plunger on the solution will hasten precipitation and I’ll end up with a layer of the drug (and blood) left in barrel. 
A real solvent for the drug I suppose is what I’m looking for. One that is also safe to inject and not ethanol. Either that or an approach/technique that does not cause the solution to thicken or drug to precipitate out once it cools. Protonitazepyne is so much easier to IV. Just add a little heat, then it stays in solution without this problem. I hope the reconstitution solution solves these problems but I am having trouble believing, I suppose I will find out soon. 
TL;DR: Help me IV 20＋ ㎎ of Protonitazene without racing against the clock solely relying on heat. 
Update: reconstitution solution arrived right after posting this and it does indeed almost completely resolve the issue. Immediately dissolves better, and after light heating helps prevents drug from precipitating out of solution into a cloudy/viscous shot. Does not completely resolve the issue though for doses 30mg+. Sub 30mg seems to nearly completely fix it though. Probably a sign to chill out but still seeking insight. I’ve read comments citing 100+ ㎎ shots so some input from those users would be super helpful.

RIP Indominate ,88,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1el6li1/rip_indominate/,"I'm sorry to be the one to have to report this, but one of the founding members of this community has passed away.
I make this post in order to give that some context.
Dom and I are members of a much smaller outside group of opi rc researchers who've been here since/before the beginning of this sub.
Dom and I both thought it was a good idea to dive right into cychlorphine, which spikes tolerance to the point that no zene will even touch you. 
I myself was on the stuff from it's first release, and for about 6 months after.
Seemed like I'd found the worst, darkest trap in a lifetime of these drugs. Worse than car-f or iso by miles.
Then SR-17018 was released, and Dom was the first among us to try it, as a therapeutic supplement, not as dope (because SR is not dope. Barely an intoxicant at all, and only after a few days or weeks of use)
Within a few days, Dom reported that he was able to substitute the SR for his entire regimen of zenes and such. Without physical withdrawal.
Was recommending things like ""a brisk walk in the morning, to help with endogenous opioid production"" 
I followed suit after a week or so of his reports, and found the same thing. No physical withdrawal, just some natural anxiety, and my tolerance dropping faster than anyone could ever have thought possible.
Then after Dom had been on SR for about 2 weeks, he went dark.
All of us who were close to him said things like ""hopefully he's living the good life, domestic strife over, maybe he just doesn't need us anymore"" and so on...
But we all knew that wasn't his way.
He was a scientist, and above that, a real friend.
If he'd found the junkie equivalent of the fountain of youth/golden parachute, he wouldn't just bail with that sort of information. Never.
A few days later, we got confirmation that he had passed away, overdosed along with someone who he loved very much.
And to me he died a hero. I mean that in every way.
Had he not recommended it, I'd still be on cychlor, awaiting the balls to shoot myself. 
I'd never have thought to try any rc that isn't at the very top tier of potency.
And even if I had, i would VERY likely have overdosed immediately afterward had it not been for his example.
Dom's diligent reports and eventual sacrifice gave me a second chance at a real life. 
I too, am now very susceptible to an unintentional overdose, for the first time in over 30 years of IV opioid addiction.
But when I consider going out and buying some blues on the street (because they'd get me high now, for the first time) I don't.
 Because while my life may still be in decades worth of pointless disrepair, I now have a chance to fix some of it, and a good man died getting me that chance.

Any recommendations for someone who doesn't want to permanently ruin tolerance?,8,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1ek9fne/any_recommendations_for_someone_who_doesnt_want/,"I only just recently discovered the world of RC opis. Before you all start telling me to turn back and all that I get it. There's a lot of ridiculously strong garbage out there that really doesn't have anything positive to offer the world but there also appears to be some that are comparable to fent and some that are in between. 
I know how to volumetrically dose properly and how to be as safe as possible but that being said the strongest opi I have tried was most likely fent. It could have been an analog of some sort, hard to say, but I had some H that was definitely cut with something really strong which jacked my tolerance up to the point that doing clean H afterwards was a complete waste. 
Now I've recently came across a few vendors with lots of different RC'S and holy fuck. There are SO many of them it's making my head spin.  Mostly ""zenes"" and some ""zepynes"" and many more. According the the vendors they all range anywhere from 50x to 1000x the potency of morphine. 
That means some of them should be around the same potency as fent, no? I think some if these could be great to try out but I doubt any of them could ever replace the warmth and depth of morphine,  H, opium,  etc... therefore I don't want to do any of the ones that might permanently ruin my tolerance to the point where I could never enjoy standard strength opiates again, if that's even really a thing. 
So that being said do you have any recommendations? And while we are on the subject,  for the people who HAVE done some of these really strong ones,  did you find the permanent tolerance ruining thing to be true or false?  If not permanent,  then how long did it take your tolerance to go down so you could enjoy something like H or morphine again?

 I woke up and took 15mg dextroamphetamine and my first cig of the day gave me a fucked up hacking cough. Thought it might be whooping cough or covid. I still think it might be covid. It's very dry. It responds pretty well to cough drops. I'm out of NyQuil.

About a half hour ago I took a 7ohmz tablet and it completely suppressed my coughs. The amphetamines may also be kicking in harder and opening up my lungs too but I took the dextroamphetamine 90mins before the 7ohmz and it didn't stop the cough. Last week I discussed how 7ohmz isn't the best for pain among kratom extract products. I'm glad it's good for coughs. I may lay off the bong rips today.

My reagent tests were consistent with ODSMT so I believe I do have it, but even 1% contamination especially if it's a hot spot could easily kill me. 
  
I have low opioid tolerance but not none, I believe kratom abuse a while back gave me permanent low-medium tolerance to opioids. I was thinking I dissolve my 2g of O in 100mL water, so 20mg/mL, to eliminate hot spots and poor accuracy of cheap scales at low doses. Then take around 100mcg worth, wait and see how I feel, then a day or two later triple, until I reach a level where I feel something (hopefully in line with ODSMT).

Tolerance and Nausea Advices,5,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1ecnamy/tolerance_and_nausea_advices/,"I recently bough some O-DSMT pellets, it's my first opioid, I bought it to find an alternative to Kratom, that I use only sometimes in specific situation.   
  
My experience with Kratom is not so bad, I don't have any tolerance because I use it every now and then, so I really need very low doses to feel it, like between 1-1.5 gr, and I consume it with plenty of water (at least 2 liters) otherwise I will feel nausea for about the whole day. I never use more then 1.5gr because I will feel very sick. I'm very sensitive. The downsides with that is that I had to use it only on an empty stomach, if not I will feel absolutely nothing.
So I took O-DSMT in the hope it could be similar to Kratom without the nausea effect. I started with 30mg on an empty stomach in the morning, I also drank water (even if not as much as when I take Kratom). Unfortunately the nausea that I experienced was worse then the one I could have on Kratom, so I had more negative feeling then good ones.
I read that boofing it will be much better, I will try for sure in the future, unfortunately I can't do that with pellets, but I don't want to waste the product so I'm asking you some advices.

Bromazolam and Metonitazene now in all brands of Diazepam ,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dvtb4t,"I firstly noticed this last year in both Accord and Actavis which were all faked bromazolam and never Diazepam anyways, but has now infiltrated every main brand of diazepam I'm used to seeing.
Bensiden, Martin Dow and MSJs. Even Temazepam, Zopiclone and Zolpidiem too. Which is a worrying trend. 
Bensiden was always my go to as I never have come across a faked pill in the form of bromazolam or anything else. I would usually have 4 in one go (40mg) first thing in the morning with my coffee. I did this a few days ago and woke up in hospital. I was lucky, I was with someone to raise alarm and I have an opioid tolerance from MAT Methadone which kept me breathing whilst the never ending wait for our fked NHS ambulance was underway. The operator eventually asked my life saver to call the police to see if they could get me to hospital because every ambulance in my area had a patient in the back of it being treated and waiting to be handed over to the hospital.
Even the police had not one free car luckily my local taxi service was able to help me. 
 I've attached some pictures of the lab reports for all who might be interested. All recent fakes with flight differences to watch 
The Bensiden containing these chemicals usually are missing the little tiny ridge/bevel you get around outside of the pill. They're sometimes shiny white, a chalky white or grey. Or have no difference at all. The ink used on the blister packets is a kittle darker though. It's very dark navy or is the old blister that had the red branding. The one before they chabhed to the same comour and font.
I'm guessing they are being produced in India, as Bensiden is a Serbian maker called Galinka and you see India mart full of these listing recently. So be careful out the folks,  not even our benzos are sacred anymore. i haven't seen them in any reports for Galinka ksols or rivotrol mind.
My understanding is that diazepam is a relatively cheap when bought as the raw powder, so is bromazolam the globe is awash with this boring benzo I've come to loathe. It does less for me than a anti histamine. So what might be the motivation to add meto to an already faked bromo tablet? Is it particularly  euphoric combo? I have even seen some Accords containing meto bromo and pregabalin. I often combine opiates with diazepam and pregabs but at known doses and intervals not all in one pill at the same time which sounds just crazy dangerous to me. Surely these fake pill makers want a living customer base. I don't  believe there is a need for  benzos when your dead so it's completely nonsensical to kill your customer base off. I mean they're addictive enough already what are they trying to achieve. 
Prgabalin is cheap as chips from Indian pharma, so is diazepam and especially bromozolam and Europe's M10s are almost completely Metonitazene if not some other nitazene and also ridiculously cheap. So what could be the idea with mixing these three different chemicals in the same pill. Or even just the bromo and meto for anyone thats tried them without passing out are they particularly euphoric?

 They won’t do it for me again and swear they made a mistake admitting me. I can’t start methadone till 4 days from now and I don’t know what to do as buprenorphine makes me go into precipe up to 8 days after I last use.

I've been dosing 100x kratom caps and they don't seem to help.,4,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1dtrm5z/is_tianeptine_wd_causing_watery_eyes_ive_been/,"So I can't post in the opiate sub for lack of participation and this is above what kratom subs can offer in terms of principal effects or withdrawal effects. 
--------
2 days ago I finished my jar of Tianeptine Free Acid and got 4 types of 100x at once. I am traveling from the 8th thru 18th to a country with sweeping bans on both kratom and opioids but I have traveled a bit and been to the UK, EU and Canada and am confident I can get through customs. I am probably gonna have to by more 7oh and plain leaf kratom because I can tell I don't have 18 days worth of kratom 100x. I get paid on the 3rd so that isn't as big an issue.
---------
I'll also be traveling with Bromazolam, Clonazepam, Amphetamines, Phenibut, and 1 4 Butanediol. I am totally fucked if all my drugs get seized traveling. Benzo WD would make my opioid WD look like a cake walk.
---------
All that isn't totally relevant but is some of the underlying concerns. Also am getting more Tianeptine Sodium and Tianeptine FA for either the days leading up to travel or for traveling. 
--------
It's been two days since tianeptine and I seemed to react well to the 4 caps I took from the 30ct I took yesterday bur I've already taken 4 more caps today but am achey with gout pain, and have watery eyes. I've thought this was a withdrawal symptom. Except it really comes on if I smoke pot. Also have been shitting too much. Very concerned they skimped on my 100x caps. 
--------
So any help would be greatly appreciated . I also woke up early and snorted 60mg of Addy, taken a dose of phenibut, 2mg of clonazepam and 3ml of 1 4 BDO. If these make WD generally worse than lmk. I could be crashing off Addy right now too.
---------
Oh and I generally take 2g per day of Tianeptine either as sodium or Free Acid. Also I've noticed the watery eyes can sometimes happen if I smoke Weed and thusly could be unrelated.
Edit: Googled a bit and seems that Addy use can cause watery eyes.
Edit: update the following day. Teezo Touchdown 🙌 free acid landed and weighed to 4.4g when I only bought 2gs for $25 with free ground advantage. The ETA was the 6th but it showed up on the 3rd. My sodium ETA is the 8th after I leave but since this was 3 days early I sorta expect that one to be a day or more early.",7/2/24 17:31,

"Are there, on this subreddit are any people that experienced side effects from benzimidazole's (nits) and could elaborate?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1ds42fa/are_there_on_this_subreddit_are_any_people_that/,"Are there, on this subreddit are any people that experienced side effects from benzimidazole's (nits) and could elaborate? Idc about some shit that you have constipation or your nose got damaged from snorting it (but if it got REALLY damaged i'd really like to know some more information :D), i mean some serious side effects. Like limbs falling out because of xylazine but milder things also interest me and there is almost no official medical researches about that sadly, (atleast i didnt find any) cause for example i read medical research about metonitazene and it was supposed to be awesome pain killer or smth but it turned out that it is very caustic and so much more shit was discovered in very early stage of the research so they didnt pursue it :(.
So, i know that using nitazenes can mak you blind in one eye, hairloss and 2 more but i dont remember rn (maybe ill edit), but if some of you have some stories about some things like that i would really like to know.
**Also, i dont ask this so that i know is it worth to use cause i know that this is such a terrible group of drugs and as a opiate-addict who loves to try new opioids ill never use it and i insist that you NEVER use it too, or if you already did then NEVER do it again.**
There is a slight posibility that i administered some RC's but i thought it was oxycodone hcl and im still pretty sure that it really was oxycodone but not 100% and im not in us and in my country and specifically in my city i haven't seen any fakes and i know that there is not much fake meds but recently i saw that in the biggest city of my country there are some faked oxycontin but it is very shitty and someone who had real oxycontin would never believe that it is real. Unless they believe that mundipharma changed the way they produce it, but also the pill was very shitty and had a lot of dots soo yeah, and even the blister was so much different than the original one.
**I highly insist to send your pills or heroin or ""pure"" fent to a lab so you can know if it is what its supposed to be. Also my advice: if you are not sure if the pill is fake and/or you dont want or cant send it for a test then just get the same pill from a 9999999% reliable source and compare if the possibly fake pill is more or less potent than the original, because i once saw some offer of counterfeit oxycodone and they said the meto amount is equivalent to 85mg of oxycodone but the reviews said that they are much less potent, probably becuase the seller used information from wikipedia or smth, that meto is fucking 1000 (or 100? im not sure) times more potent than morphine and we all know that this is very very exaggerated.**

#NAME?,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1drlhmw/zene_half_life_question/,"My GF and I recently moved to a new city and are waiting to get into a methadone clinic. We've been here about a month and a half to two months and have successfully cold copped/found a plug in the mean time for now.. everything has been going alright for the most part up until this past week. I think before we moved we were doing some sort of zene analogue, not sure which one tbh, but the 0 euphoria, how much more I was getting backed up bowel wise, and the fact that it would take almost 36-48 hours from last use to start feeling WD symptoms, I knew it def wasn't normal fet (if anything out there is anymore).. Fast forward back to this week, the shit we've been getting here has been keeping us well for the most part up until few days ago. It was a new batch, and we'd start getting sick literally an hour or two after doing a line, which hasnt happened to us in a super long time, and is starting to get frustrating with how much we're having to redose/spend more money than we can afford etc etc.. but I'm starting to think maybe we're getting fet now and it's not touching our zene tolerance so we're still WD from the zenes and the fet gives us very short lived relief. Even with extremely long half lifes, shouldn't this have start d to happen much much sooner than now? I figured it should have started to happen within the first week. I started questioning the quality of this new batch our dude just got, and he swears no one else has said anything or complained etc etc. so idk if it's just a shit batch, or is it super delayed zene WDs.. I've been waking up in the middle of the night having to redose, wake up sick which hasn't happened in such a long time. I just don't get what's happening. Has this happened to anyone else? Is it possible there's some new super lengthy zene with an insane half life that it would take over a month for WDs to kick in?

But I blew out all my veins, I mean so damn many. They use that little machine that can see through your skin to find blood vessels somehow (need to get me one of those gadgets....) and even that sucks, the one time I ODd 6 different nurses couldn't get hand or arm access so they resorted to a little butterfly needle in my neck for IV. I was sober for 5 years save for low dose Subutex, then had a severe chronic pain issue crop up (need hip replacement, fucking sucks so bad at this age) and finally found a surgeon who isn't a retard that ""hurr durr don't want to operate on a 40yr old cause you're just gonna need another replacement in 20 years."" Uh, it's my fucking body, I'd prefer not to be in agony, having had to turn to fentanyl to manage pain, and maybe have second hip replacement when I'm much older. But new surgeon wants me off the fentanyl and I just don't know what to do. My mat docs pushed my Subutex dose up to 24mg which is an idiotic amount of bupe, but I never take that much.

[https://www.reddit.com/user/jtjdp/comments/11jbjmy/the\_secret\_lives\_of\_33diphenylpropylamines/](https://www.reddit.com/user/jtjdp/comments/11jbjmy/the_secret_lives_of_33diphenylpropylamines/)  
[sampling of the diversity of the opioid chemical space of the 3,3-diphenylpropylamine mu-opioid pharmacophore](https://preview.redd.it/10nxruw3qv7d1.png?width=1774&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d5b1f925bd85962fa4479caca6e635fc7c76a1c)
  
The synth of methadone and the amine substituted derivs are essentially the same. Following the same sequence of steps from the shared starting material, diphenylacetonitrile, (the limiting reagent in all of these reactions).  
  
Dipyanone, methadone as well as another two diphenylpropylamine opioids featuring a beta-methyl substitution (methyl substituent branching from the beta carbon)--dipipanone and phenadoxone--vary little in the nature, duration and solvents involved at each stage of the rxn.  
  
The original synthesis of all four of these compounds was elucidated by Bockmuhl & Ehrhart. These two researchers at Hoechst AG discovered methadone in 1938 and published the US patent in late 1941, shortly before Germany went to war with USA. The war 'forfeited' the german ownership rights to the compounds, therefore the peer review study of Bockmuhl's synthesis of methadone, which include dipyanone, waited until 1949, long after hostilities ceased, to be published. In the interim. British and American investigators patented-published procedures and claimed priority (ownership) over the other methadone relatives that would emerge as later opioid RCs or were released clinically (most, other than methadone, were of limited commercial success, and were adopted by formularies for a few decades--at most). Because dipyanone was not adopted into preclinical or clinical development, it was less popular than the competing ring-expanded derivs, such as 6-membered piperidino deriv, *dipipanone*, and the 6-membered morpholine ring, *phenadoxone* (morpholine is a ring in which an oxygen heteroatom is present at position 4, opposite the nitrogen at position 1).  
The synthesis is the same regardless of which methadone derivative is being pursued. The only variation is the nature of the amine substituent of the chloropropylamine or its aminopropanol precursor. The amine systems in all but methadone are cyclic (see below):  
  
methadone features a dimethylamino, dipipanone = piperidino, phenadoxone = morpholino, and dipyanone = pyrrolidino.
Steps adapted from ***Part I: Synthesis of Isomethadone*** found here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/jtjdp/comments/11jbjmy/the\_secret\_lives\_of\_33diphenylpropylamines/](https://www.reddit.com/user/jtjdp/comments/11jbjmy/the_secret_lives_of_33diphenylpropylamines/)
First, we'll cover the basic homogeneous single-phase reaction of the ***SN2 condensation*** developed by Bockmuhl & Ehrhart in their original synthesis of methadone. This will be adapted for dipyanone as an example of how the original methadone procedure and starting materials are adapted for use in amine-substituted derivatives.  
  
Bockmuhl begins by generating the sodium salt of the carbanion of diphenylacetonitrile \[cmpnd # 5\] which can be accomplished by abstracting a Proton from diphenylacetonitrile \[#3\] using NaH or NaNH2 --> 2 molar equivalents of the homogenous base are recommended, 2 x molar equiv based on the limiting reagent \[#3\]. this condensation is performed in a suitable organic solvent such as anhydrous toluene or mixed xylenes (using homogenous conditions necessitates anhydrous rxn conditions and, therefore, dry solvents--dried and stored tightly sealed under dessicantion--are req'd).   
  
Alternative organic bases can be used in place of metallic Na, NaNH2 (sodamide) or NaH (sodium hydride), such as Na ethoxide (or a potassium alkoxides, such as methoxide, propoxide, or isopropoxide) or an analogous K or cesium-based alkalis.
https://preview.redd.it/nekojrcrqv7d1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5879d1f8e558810b849467d9d82ec3abc7760cfd
The next step involves introducing the chloropropylamine \[cmpnds #1 or #2\] aka ""CPA"" to the diphenylacetonitrile \[#3\]. Technically, the CPA being used is often referred to a ""chloroisopropylamine."" For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to these starting materials, either ***1-pyrrolidino-2-chloropropane*** \[cmpnd #1\] or ***2-pyrrolidino-1-chloropropane*** \[cmpnd #2\] simply as ""CPA.""
Note: either isomeric chloropropylamine can be used, cmpnd #1 or #2, and you will yield the same isomeric pair of aminonitrile products. This is due to the tricyclic aziridinium intermediate \[cmpnd #4\] which forms upon exposure of either #1 or #2 to strong base ---> forming the base of either #1 or #2 causes either of the CPA isomers to undergo rearrangement (spontaneously) into intermediate \[#4\]. This happens predictably and reliably (As long as it is exposed to suitably basic conditions during the SN2 condensation rxn).  
  
The particular CPA reagent preferred for this rxn is N-pyrrolidino-2-chloropropane \[#1\], note the amine moiety is cyclic (5-membered pyrrolidine), while the dimethylamino of the analogous reagent used in the course of methadone synthesis is non-cyclic **\[specifically, the methadone-isomethadone synthesis is pictured in above diagram\]**. In this case , the amine corresponds to the pyrrolidine ring required for dipyanone.  
  
The CPA is introduced in the form of its free base \[#4\] --> a viscous yellow oil obtained by freeing the base of the CPA \* HCl salt obtained commercially or by prep'n of the chloropropylamine (in situ) by chlorination (via SOCl2) of the appropriately substituted pyrrolidino aminopropanol --> the aminopropanol can be prepared by condensation of propylene oxide with N-pyrrolidine in dry toluene under stirring and adequate heat.
The CPA freebase \[#4\] + diphenylacetonitrile \[#3\] are stirred in the presence of the basic catalyst (chosen from the options listed earlier) for at least 4 hrs--I prefer 8 hrs in order to ensure full rxn of starting materials--under refluxing toluene (reflux temp 110 C) or mixed xylenes (reflux temp 135 C). the xylenes are preferred for higher reflux temps and therefore more complete reaction. (I'm also a bit 'anal'/perfectionist when it comes to certain things, such as rxn completeness and maximizing yield).
The rxn is then worked up in the same manner as afforded in the methadone synthesis literature (see erowid/hive writeup on ""[Synthesis of Methadone](https://chemistry.mdma.ch/hiveboard/rhodium/methadone.html)""). This is available on erowid and in the many references contained within the Erowid summary. The primary differences will be the different melting temps of the intermediate amino nitrile isomers. and to account for the added molecular weight of the dipyanone nitrile compared to the methadone nitrile. This MW difference is very small, on the order of an ethylene subunit. bear in mind all your acid base extractions of this aminonitrile workup are performed in significant molar excess. Therefore, the precise mol weight of your product won’t matter during the work up phase, as adequate acid-base will be available. But the MW will be needed to calculate, among other things, your yield. The precise ratio of intermediate amino nitrile will be the same as that yielded in the methadone-isomethadone synthesis: approx 50:50 or 45:55 in slight favor of dipyanone nitrile (the beta-methyl isomer) vs its alpha methyl “iso-dipyanone nitrile.” These are separated using differential solubility (via recrystallization) from hexane or heptane (ideally) or in 91% isopropanol (IPA) , conveniently found in OTC rubbing alcohol.
The solubility  of the beta-methyl “dipyanone nitrile” (proper) is much less than the isomeric isodipyanone nitrile (alpha methyl isomer) in all three recrystallization solvents. Hexane or heptane recrystallization providing superior separation vs IPA. But IPA is worthwhile as the advantage in yield is minimal and IPA is much cheaper/easier to procure and significantly less toxic compared to hexane-heptane.
Given the trend observed in related aminonitriles of the diphenylpropylamine class opioids (such as methadone and dipipanone nitriles and their alpha methyl isomers), dipyanone nitrile is expected to melt at higher temp than its isomeric isodipyanone nitrile (isomer wherein the methyl group has shifted to the alpha carbon). The isodipyanone nitrile melts at 107-109 C (free base) or 225-227 C (as the HCl salt). Oddly, the literature is absent the value for a melting point for the plain-vanilla dipyanone nitrile. 
source:  Paul Janssen, ""**Synthetic Analgesics, Part I: Diphenylpropylamines**"" (1960)
I would continue but this doesn't allow full images/diagrams to be posted in-line with text. So I've decided to post more on this later. you can follow the same steps I posted about isomethadone and methadone nitriles and the subsequent grignard condensation with Ethyl Magnesium Bromide in the reddit post from my profile u/jtjdp posted below:
[https://www.reddit.com/user/jtjdp/comments/11jbjmy/the\_secret\_lives\_of\_33diphenylpropylamines/](https://www.reddit.com/user/jtjdp/comments/11jbjmy/the_secret_lives_of_33diphenylpropylamines/)
this has much more info, detailed experimental sections and diagrams of the synth steps. Just substitute in N-pyrrolidine ring for the N,N-dimethylamine moiety of methadone/isomethadone moiety.
isodipyanone will retain a good deal of the analgesic activity present in plain vanilla dipyanone (about 75%). You may also observe superior euphoria (albeit not superior analgesia) in the alpha-methyl isodipyanone isomer. This phenomena of higher euphoria, slightly lower analgesic is observed in many of the amine substituted congeners of methadone-isomethadone.
***The grignard step in brief:***  
  
achieving the ethyl ketone from the nitrile requires reacting the desired aminonitrile + ethyl magnesium bromide (or iodide) under heat in xylene at 110-120 deg C for 12-24 hrs, followed by extended reflux in concentrated hydrochloric acid (or HBr if seeking the slightly more hydrolysis resistant isodipyanone, the alpha-methyl group making the aminonitrile precursor somewhat more resistant to acid hydrolysis, necessitating the use of more concentrated HCl or switching over the hydrobromic acid, from the weaker hydrochloric).

Is it soluble in PG? Is that a good medium for long term storage if I wanted to smoke it? How about for IV use. Water and ascorbic acid?

Vacuumed the office. Worked up a sweat as I live in a particularly warm part of the world. Finally sat down at my desk. Going to perform a few benchmark tests and see where I’m at. I don’t really feel any effects so to speak. I am wondering if I took too low of a dose.

Still very limited opioid activity sadly. I’m assuming the dose was too low for my tolerance. I’ve always had a naturally high tolerance to opioids sadly. Going to make dinner now but I am not expecting much. I’m going to have a scotch with dinner which will hopefully boost the effects.

Chronic pain recommendations for no tolerance,3,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1ddclbh/chronic_pain_recommendations_for_no_tolerance/,"Hi! 
I have hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos, an extremely painful and disabling genetic disorder caused by my body making collagen wrong - imagine a house made with crap from temu, and that's my body. 
So all connective tissue, especially ligaments, are just crap and don't work properly, so my joints sublux (partially dislocate) multiple times daily, sometimes upwards of a dozen times, and my muscles are extremely tight and painful from trying to hold them together constantly (and failing). Muscle relaxers make me fall apart because nothing holds my joints in place. I'm 21 and have been just getting more and more disabled from the pain for 2-3 years, and my doctors won't prescribe pain meds. My mental health is crashing and I need relief. ETA: to clarify, from the constant moderate to severe pain, not the mental suffering. That's the cause. 
Weed helps a bit, though edibles make subluxations worse. I have never used recreational opioids. Kratom is illegal here, but when I was able to get it, it helped mildly. But that deep, aching subluxation pain is not even touched. I somehow have multiple joints subluxed right now. 
I also have hyperpots, which is like POTS but with norepinephrine dumps instead of low BP when I stand, so my BP goes up instead. So I don't know if anything that works on norepinephrine receptors majorly is a good idea. Tramadol made me extremely irritable and I was too out of it to notice if my hyperpots was flaring. I do also have gastroparesis, which I expect will get worse, but I genuinely cannot handle this level of baseline pain anymore with no breaks. I'm going fricken crazy. I'm in therapy and my therapist believes I need access to pain meds too. 
So, here I am, I've been researching this for the past several hours. I don't want to have to self medicate, especially with such a complex body (as in, with many under researched medical conditions), but I feel I have no choice after being abandoned by doctors. Does anyone have any ideas on what may work best for me? I am hoping to be able to use a few times a week at most for severe pain. I specifically was intruiged by methionine and SR-17018. I'm in the US. 
Was also looking into poppies, as I see it as the ideal option honestly, but I live with my parents, and I'm not sure how discreet it is. I also don't know how accepting they'd be. They see opioids as an absolute last resort. I was there awhile ago. I am suffering. 
Apologies for the length, but I really appreciate any help. This has the potential to seriously change my life.

Protonitazene water solubility? And questions regarding ROA's,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1d96g8d/protonitazene_water_solubility_and_questions/,"Hi guys,
Just received 135x proto blotters. Have been sublingualing with satisfactory effects, however I'm curious about smoking and insufflating these somehow. 
Would it be possible, to say put half a blotter (.5mg) in .5mls of hot water, let the substance dissolve into the solution then spray it up my nose with either a nasal spray or oral syringe?
I know you can smoke them with a direct flame then inhalation obviously, but I'm trying to figure out a way to circumvent the platform of these small cardboard blotters. Theoretically boofing would work too as the mucosa would absorb the proto from the blotters with fluid applied too, but the bioavailabiltiy would be pretty fucking high so it might be a tad dangerous.

I never smoked that bc I had yet to switch to tia sodium so I could hit first poke Everytime no matter how full the pin. Now I got on IV tia for less than a year in maybe 2016 but in that time it collapsed so many veins that I've is not only not what I wanna do these days, but if I get something weaker and I need to make it last it's very difficult and time consuming. I mostly stick with boofing O-DSMT now, but there are days I run out before it arrives so I copnofnthebone street source I have. 2 batches ago he had this stuff so strong that 30mg boofed produced a rush beyond a full point of anything he'd gotten me previously, and half that the few times i had a successful IV produced a stronger rush. He's gotten all colors of the rainbow, but I'm pretty positive they were all zenes/nitazenes/or pynes bc I have been drug tested many times via PO while having to get by on these mystery meats. The super strong one was white and looks exactly like what I have now but I have to boof a whole point to get an effect somewhat similar to the 35mg of what he called freeze. Like I sent him with $100 bc he said he was copping and it was gonna be freeze grade. Even said it was in fact freeze grade when I finally picked it up. With the rush I got from boofing 35mg of freeze I know boofing 100-120mg would have killed me. With this 100mg produces a nice high but I need 120mg to really feel like I did 35mg of what he calls freeze. So my question is would smoking whatever zene is in it on foil have a better BA than boofing? If I could hit 50-70mg would rock my world but I can't and for $100/g I'd rather get more than 10 solid doses ya know? So if smoking works better I'd rather do whatever is gonna produce the best result with the least amount of product per dose. That's why I'm here. I don't wanna put 75mg,-100mg on foil and finish to feel nothing compared to a 100mg boof yk? Should I plug or should I smoke, if I plug I must use IV dose double, but if I smoke idk what if I gotta triple... So come on and let me know should I boof or should I smoke?!!!!",6/5/24 18:15,

IC-26 (Methiodone): 
When I first received the sample, the powder clumped together very easily and stuck to any surface it came in contact with making it challenging to transfer from plastic baggie to a different container.
After sitting for months in a cool dry dark place, the powder has dried and is no longer sticky however it is still in small clumps. 40mg is weighed out and dissolved in 100ml water.

Allergy test (1ml ingested orally)
No strong chemical taste, non acidic, no burning sensation in the mouth. 
1530 Main dose taken. 
+0:00
No effects from the allergy test. While it would be wise to titration up over the course of a few hours double the dose every 30min, I recklessly and impatiently decide to take my chances with the remaining dose. (99ml/40mg ingested orally) No taste like before. Sat down on the couch to play some Pokémon HeartGold. 
+0:23
Slightly impaired/delayed processing speed. Body feeling slightly heavy. No noticeable euphoria. Slightly frustrated at Pokémon game as AI are using toxic stall. 
+0:41
Noticeable sedation becomes apparent. My face begins to droop slightly and I take on that typical opiate frown. Still no strong euphoria. I decide I’m going to mow the lawn before it gets dark. I’ll finish the part I’m at in Pokémon and save the game before heading outside to mow.
+1:45
Finished mowing the lawn just as the sun was beginning to set. Very dry mouth and itchy nose however the itchy nose is likely due to pollen/grass particles. Back of my throat feels uncomfortable due to extremely dry mouth. Going to drink some water then go on a walk with gf. Still no strong euphoria of note however I feel quite content. 
+2:15
Just got back from the walk. I was extremely itchy the entire time. Arms, eyes, inner elbows, shoulders, etc. all extremely itchy. My eyes are quite red and bloodshot as well. I’m going to take a shower and hopefully the itchiness will subside. I still don’t feel any strong euphoria and I’m not particularly sedated either. Will shower and get comfortable then update.
+3:00
Itching subsided after the shower. Now cooking some pasta with my gf and going to have a beer. I’m enjoying the contentedness and slightly stoned feeling. I’m being very goofy with my gf and she’s getting a bit annoyed but she’s pretty used to my stupid antics at this point. Definitely not nearly as euphoric as other opioids such as oxycodone or O-DSMT but I also took a fairly low dose for my tolerance. Will report back to see how the alcohol interacts.
+3:40
Ate pasta with my gf and it was great. No nausea or loss of appetite like I’ve experienced with other opioids. The beer smacked me super hard and made the opioid effects much more pronounced. Stronger sedation, slight euphoria now, analgesia, heavy arms and legs, and minor brain fog/slowed thought process, just to name some of the immediately obvious effects. Going to watch a film now. 
+7:10
Just finished Sex and the City. I felt very sedated throughout the film and a few times it was difficult to keep my eyes open. I did begin to feel some pressure in my head and am currently experiencing a painful tension headache. I assumed it could be dehydration but I’ve been drinking plenty of fluids.

RCs Similar to 2map?,6,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1cpyrot/rcs_similar_to_2map/,"Please help me find the best 2map alternative for dosing 3-7 times per week.
I have been using 2map for a couple of years. I'm currently using 30mg/day, but I'm tapering this down to eliminate some minor withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, body tension after 18 hours without dosing). Sadly, I don't think 2map will be available any more, so I'm trying to figure out the best replacement before I run out.
Here is what I am looking for:
1. Short duration. I like that I can dose 2map once at night and it's over in a couple of hours. It also helps me sleep better. I do not want something you can still feel the next day. The shorter lasting drugs should build less of a tolerance and have less severe withdrawals than something that lasts a long time, like O-DSMT.
2. Feels good, but not too extreme. 2map gives me a warm & cozy feeling but I have never gotten nausea, itching, or nodded off. I'm looking for an RC that will give you a chill and manageable high. There should be some euphoria but nothing crazy.
3. Can dose more frequently without having bad withdrawals/tolerance. Because 2map is so short lasting, you can use it more frequently and withdrawals won't be too bad as long as you don't push the dose. So, I'm looking for the safest option that doesn't have terrible withdrawals or jack up your tolerance.
4. Not ultra-potent, if possible. I have read several horror stories in this subreddit about bad withdrawal symptoms that people get from the super potent zenes and cyclorphine. But, I'm not sure if there is something inherently more dangerous about zenes, or if people have worse withdrawals because they can reach higher tolerance levels due to the potency. It's a lot of risk to receive these in the mail and try to make a solution without inhaling a speck of powder. These also seem more likely to get emergency scheduled at some point. I would be worried about getting caught with this, due to the association with other potent opioids like fentanyl.
5. It needs to have predictable effects at the same dose. Also, it should have a high theraputic index, and minimal risk of OD at moderate doses.
6. Unscheduled in the U.S.
7. Reduce anxiety. It should not have stimulating properties like O-DSMT with its NRI agonism.
8. Must be soluble in P.G. for rectal administration. I've read some things about zenes being hard to dissolve, and one undissolved speck could be a big problem.
  
Here are the options I'm considering:
- SR-17018. This one seems promising, but I can't find much info online about the duration.
- Isotonitazepyne
- N-Desethylprotonitazene
- Cychlorphine
- N-Desethyletonitazene
If anyone has zene/cyclorphine experience, please let me know if it's possible to dose these at an amount and frequency so you don't get withdrawals or a big tolerance increase. Even if it's just once per week, that's better than nothing.
  
2map was perfect for me, and I'm kicking myself for not stocking up more. If there is no suitable 2map alternative, I might quit opioids and try something else that is relaxing and mildly euphoric, for 2 hours before bed, every night. FXE and Delta 8 might work, but I'm not sure. CBD was ok, but not euphoric enough. If you have any ideas, let me know.",5/12/24 3:36,

So i got my hands on some O-DSMT HCL pellets with 50mg each.

Isotonitazene,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1ch1oci/isotonitazene/,"Does anyone have experience quitting this stuff?  Quick recap,  I started using fentanyl back in 2020, with blues but quickly found a connect that had fentanyl rock. I loved it, honestly.  I had been using it for about one year, when my guy said be careful with this bag, it’s stronger than anything I’ve given you before.    This first bag, had a citrusy chem taste, and the smallest puff of it had me nodding harder than anything ive had.   I actually remember telling my girl that it scared me.   I’d be awake, then bam, waking back up    
I told my dealer I did not like this stuff, which later I found out was iso, and went back onto the colored fetty rocks.   However, now I was smoking much more.    After only a couple weeks, my tolerance was so high that a ball of fetty would not even last me 1 day anymore where it used to be a monthly supply.  
I then, switched to iso.   That puff and nod very quickly faded to where I can sit here and smoke it all day long until it runs out.   I’ve had withdrawls a few times and legitimately wanted to kill myself the last time I had withdrawls.     My goal is to make sure I always have it on me now.   I pay rent, bills, and then my main focus is iso supply.  
I no longer get high, but I can’t quit or else I’m so sick I cry, and cradle myself in a fetal position.  
Any advice or tips would be appreciated.   And to those interested In iso,  be warned…. This stuff is no joke.  It’s extremely potent, and will make fentanyl seem like Tylenol to you.  ",4/30/24 19:38,

SR-17018,38,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1cakk9s/sr17018/,"This drug has saved my life. As a long time addict and an RC OG I've fucked with a little bit of everything. A lot more of some things than others. Once I crossed the buprenorphine barrier with nitazenes I tried multiple times to go back to buprenorphine with no success, extreme precipitated withdrawal. Then cychlorphine entered the picture- even nitazenes/ zepynes couldn't keep me well much less get me high. Extremely powerful amnesiac drug with no euphoria and extreme respiratory depression. The most dangerous drug I have ever encountered. (And I've encountered plenty of the ones high up the F tree). I hope cychlorphine gets murdered with every abrasive adjective that can be conceived.
SR-17018 came into the picture and saved my life. It's a biased g protein MOR agonist that reverses and decreases tolerance with very little, if any, respiratory depression. 
It has low binding affinity and rapid internalization, so its an all or nothing kinda deal. If you go on SR for a week then pound some old NDI cottons you might be a dead 💀. Compulsory recovery without withdrawal. Thank the Lord.",4/22/24 19:58,

And I think I've done enough to know I shouldn't be messing with it more than just 12hr sessions to keep ur titration regimen in order and then start nose spray in decreased dosage and if I have enough will power to stay with me ill be OK. But sniffing nose spray is so much different than vaping.  It is not cool how much different so that's why we have an issue with this stuff. I know I shouldn't have said anything to you guys about buying it.  But I want to try it because I guess hubris but it was a stupid decision and I am glad I flushed around 300mg I weighed out 300mg and there was about that left in the bag and I flushed it. I needed nosespray for titration down. But I just don't want it anymore and I'm very unhappy about my decision.  I'm sorry to complain about it. Most you all expect it to be that way

All right, first of all, I read that you cannot vape it, and you cannot dissolve it in water. This really makes things difficult.

Either you dissolve it in Ethanol or glycerin(btw, can you mix ethanol and glycerine in the same solution if you don't want to add any more alcohol and you don't want is as viscous as glycerin?)

With the Ethanol, I wonder how pure you have to have it, (would 40% vodka do the trick, or do you need pure ethanol 96%?) and how much would you need approximately to dissolve 50mg. Would it be enough with 0.5dl(50ml) of vodka, would would make it 1mg/ml. From here, you can dilute it further, maybe in water or glycerin or more alcohol.

If Wikipedia is correct that it is 20x more powerful than fentanyl (but their cited source doesn't touch the topic on HOW they came to those conclusions.

Hi everyone,

I just received 1g of IC-26 (methiodone) but I'm kinda anxious to try it.. I searched for some report/experiences from people taking this substance, but I couldn't find much. 

I'm especially looking for experience from people with low tolerance to opiates.

From what I found, it seems that this is basically methadone, right? So dosage/safety/duration-wise, 10mg should be enough for a whole day, no? 

I will keep you guys updated once I experience with it (maybe make a report hour by hour).

I have previous experience with protopyne and it was very good but caustic and burned my nose and was very rough on the lungs and made it hard to breathe after repeated usage.

About a week ago I received n-desethyl-proto I read a review that said it was almost better than the original proto but when I got it I first did an allergy test. Just a tiny tiny bit wouldn’t even register on my scale then i did 1 mg smoked nothing then 5mg nothing again then 20mg then 100mg all spaced out within a night. Then the next day I did 100 mg insufflated(snort) and oh boy it tore through my nose intense pain made my eyes water and I couldn’t take it I resorted to snorting water and then blowing my nose to get it to stop then I snorted 50mg after that and it wasn’t as painful but long story short I used more and more and nothing ever hapenned.

I know alot of Rx meds in the states are in bottles but in Europe, the UK and outside of north America most come In blister packs.

At the moment most diazepam apart from imports like bensedin from Serbia that are real the rest are fake and probably has brom in them some of the pills are pressed and finished well come in well made blister packs in a card box with braille on them and even a UK style info paper, as in they have almost perfected the packaging but the pills are fake.

I quickly realized that with nitazenes that wouldn't work since they fry your receptors.

So the only 2 options currently available are methiodone (a methadone analog) and cychlorphine (a brorphine analog). O-DSMT and 2-map are also not that expensive on bulk, but they're on the same level as polish oxy, so no point. Methiodone and cychlorphine are really, really cheap.

Been trying to read a lot but I'm still undecided. Methiodone has the lack of euphoria and being harder to quit and a prolonged WD. Cychlorphine would have been fine if it was really that similar to fentanyl, as they say it is. If it only affected tolerance as much as fentanyl. But I'm not really that sure.

Etorphine same class as brorphine and cychlorphine?,6,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1br73kc/etorphine_same_class_as_brorphine_and_cychlorphine/,"Is etorphine the same class as brorphine and cychlorphine? They all end in the same way, -orphine. (We know that the latter two are the same class).

On my endless quest to find out whether cychlorphine will screw your receptors as much as nitazenes, this could perhaps help me unveil the mystery... Because also according to google etorphine seems to have a very similar intrinsic efficacy to fentanyl, so maybe the same would be true for brorphine and cychlorphine?

In short: maybe cychlorphine isn't a superagonist (since its intrinsic efficacy could be similar to fentanyl which also isn't) and therefore won't screw your receptors as much as nitazenes which we know are superagonists?",3/30/24 2:43,

Are fentanyls as bad for tolerance as nitazenes?,4,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1bnqor0/are_fentanyls_as_bad_for_tolerance_as_nitazenes/,"For those who have dabbled with both, I'd like to know of your experiences.

I myself never tried any nitazenes, but I've tried pharma fentanyl. I once chewed fentanyl patches for 30 days straight, at 6mg of sublingual fentanyl per day (half a 75mcg/h patch which have 12mg of fentanyl according to google). I kept feeling euphoria every day.

Yet after this I went back to my previous habit of 1g of codeine per day with no WD symptoms whatsoever. After a week my tolerance came back to normal and I was getting high on codeine again. (This was 6 months into my opioid addiction, and I would keep being able to get high on codeine for another 2-3 years - so it seems like a month straight on a generous (but not insane, not 300mg/day) fent dose didn't do much damage to my receptors).

Yet people say that fentanyl completely wrecks your receptors. Some people need 250-300mg of methadone after fentanyl.

What this leads me to think is that fentanyl doesn't wreck your receptors that much if consumed at lower doses, but instead allows for much bigger doses to be consumed (because of being much cheaper) and to be reached much quicker than with ""normal"" opioids.

So perhaps it could be the same with zenes and people are overblowing it (since people say they're even worse than fentanyl).

So for those who have done both, tell me honestly how does the effect on tolerance compare, and tell me also when did you stop feeling euphoria with each (and tell us also amounts and frequency consumed).",3/25/24 22:09,

Anyone ever tried zenes to control acute severe pain? Works with some opioid tolerance?,7,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1bk479t/anyone_ever_tried_zenes_to_control_acute_severe/,"Seriously, I have no idea of how can anyone enjoy ketamine. I took my first dose, which was 40mg snorted, and I felt exactly like a post I recently read on the ketamine sub described, nothing but ""dissociated with zero emotion"" for one hour. It felt really really awful.

I dread this because I have been diagnosed with a kidney stone, and when it decides to come out it will very probably cause very extreme pain as usual, and only ketamine will provide quick pain relief, since I'm on 50mg of methadone and also have previously screwed my tolerance with poppy pods. NSAIDs are very effective for renal colic and I also made a NSAID nasal spray (to act much quicker than oral, almost as quick as IV) but even IV NSAIDs take up to 30min to work whereas intranasal ketamine works in 5 minutes.

So I was thinking of making a zene nasal spray instead since you can no longer get fentanyl RCs, which will even punch through the methadone. Will it provide any significant relief for someone like me who fucked his tolerance with poppy pods, who's been for 10 years on opioids (even though the first 9 were just codeine), and who's on 50mg of methadone?

First was just the metonatazine but right now we have best results with a recipe involving those three ingredients plus cut with insotol. 

Last order we had found metonatazine that was reddish orange and the quality was like nothing else. Ordered the same amount that lasted a year last time and it's been three months only and we need to look into getting something else before we run out.

I'm terrified of the withdrawal because we live in a small town with no car, or else id feel safe with the methadone clinic as a fallback. Last time I got off the stuff I was going to the methadone clinic and 180mg worked for me. Unfortunately my husband does not consider methadone an option or subs, and we don't have money for daily heroin, though it's so much better in both of our opinion.

I'm thinking that the tolerance effect of ntzines drops off within a week, that's how long it took us last time we ran out to be able to get well on a normal dose of heroin, as in less than a point IV at a time. 

Point of this post is, do you guys see any difference in availability of things like red metonatazine from China suppliers? Now I'm not sourcing, please, I'm just asking if you guys can find these things still. If you can I'm sure I can too I just want to know if there's been some reduction in availability of high quality ntzines since last year. Ps, I've used them since 2020, minus the past year on methadone.

Cychlorphine & IC-26 / Methiodone,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1aydekb/cychlorphine_ic26_methiodone/,"I have recently tested these two substances and wanted to give some initial feedback for others. 

I vaped Cychlorphine using 20mg dissolved in 0.5ml Vodka, then mixed into 10ml PG Vape fluid. The taste is weak. The Wodka has to be warm and the Cychlorphine pulverised very finely, then the solubility is no problem. 1 hit would be (barely) noticeable (some tolerance but well-configured ULDN).

The onset is fast and there is significant euphoria, which lasts 1-3 hours. There is lingering effects which are particularly sedative. I have never tried Brorphine, so can’t compare. I regularly developed a headache, and became very sick physically within a week of consuming it daily. Another unique side effect was intense sweating. I am not sure whether this was because of increasing dosages, didn’t feel like the classical sickness you sometimes get in the beginning of a period of consuming. It was however, the strongest opioid I’ve consumed yet. Overall, I do not like the substance too much due to this aspect. Relatively fiendish as well. It does have nice dopaminergic effects though (I am currently on it after a 2 day break and enjoy myself - I would never post sober). 

Methiodone felt like not taking an opioid at all, almost no effects at 20mg oral dosing. Intend to go higher. It definitely works for mitigating withdrawal, quite well. 

On a scale of 1-10 valuing general pleasure, 10 being my favourite opioid Tilidine and 1 being something really shit (couldn’t think of an unpleasurable opioid lol), I’d give Cychlorphine a 5 and Methiodone a 4. ODSMT would be a 7 and Oxycodone a 9. Cyc would be a 7 if it weren’t for the side effects which might not have been idiosyncratic effects, but probably were to a good degree.

I think, it is worth a shot.

1.2.1 Indications

Phenacetin was used as an analgesic and fever-reducing drug in both human and veterinary medicine for many years. It was introduced into therapy in 1887 and was extensively used in analgesic mixtures until it was implicated in kidney disease (nephropathy) due to abuse of analgesics. Phenacetin also was once used as a stabilizer for hydrogen peroxide in hair-bleaching preparations (IARC, 1980; Nugent & Hall, 2000).

1.2.2 Dosage

Analgesic mixtures containing phenacetin were previously marketed as tablets or capsules containing between 150 and 300 mg phenacetin. Common combinations were: 150 mg phenacetin, 230 mg aspirin, and 15 or 30 mg caffeine; or 150 mg phenacetin, 230 mg aspirin, 30 mg caffeine, and 8, 15, 30, or 60 mg codeine phosphate. Phenacetin alone was also available in 250 and 300 mg doses as tablets, and up to 500 mg doses as powder. The usual dose was 300 mg 4–6 times per day, and the daily dose was not to exceed 2 g (IARC, 1977, 1980).

So, a couple months ago a ""friend"" of mine that works in a chemical company had (like every year) Acetorphine for analytical purposes and I had a very little amount (but since is powerful not much is needed) this is my ""trip report"".
I have chronic pain and Huntington's and I already use opioids for pain (I am on 160-240 mg of Oxycodone a day plus 3 800 mcg Fentanyl for breakthrough pain), in comparison to Oxycodone Acetorphine is far more sedating, especially IV, something similar to Hydromorphone, the duration of action (based on how much time my pain was lowered) is more or less like the other morphinan-structure opioids, so ~4h, the bioavailability (compared to IV/IM - IN and OS use) is 100% for IV (obviously) something near 60-70% IN and 40-50% orally (again, this is based just on my response to pain, not to mesaurations).
I have used doses from 20 to 100 mcg (+-20 to 100 mg Morphine OS, I have an analyticalbalance and maling IV and IN solutions is easy) (Since DHE, which is has a similar potency, is used in similar doses, even if sublingual) in various ROAs and apart from the potency is quite similar to Oxy, although I had much less itching (a side effect that I usually have, specially with Fentanyl).
Can't tell much more, but honestly it seems a great molecule for pain management, however I have no hopes that this could and would be used in the near future since the new drug policies (thanks DEA!!).
Whish there was more possibility of experimentation, specially for chronic pain, however, since is difficult to produce, powerful and difficult to manage without proper experience I'm 100% sure this substance will never reach the market nor medical studies

I’m on 180mg methadone, and I just had some major surgery.   I’ve no pins with needles still on them, but I’ve 1 ml syringes for measuring solution.   I’ve took about 50 micrograms orally, not expecting much, but I wanted to play it safe and start low.         I remember getting really drowsy about 20 min after swallowing my small liquid dose of one of the supposedly strongest fentalogues known to man….  
      I finally was out today and picked up some proper syringes to really give this sample a proper testing.   I’ve had it yrs ago from a DN vendor, I paid much much more back then , but it was quality.   I recall working up to the sweet spot , shot after shot , till I knew exactly how much to add to water. I just used Tap water then because I didn’t give much of a fuck, and I was using 24/7 so the solution didn’t last more than 2 days before I was mixing another 30 ml solution.  
      I know do give a fuck, and can’t afford to be slamming opioids 24/7 anymore. The methadone might be blocking it since I’m up to 180mg/ daily, but I would imagine I can break through any blocking effects.  
     I still plan on saving for special occasions, and want to use some bacteriostatic water to mix my solution with, as I can imagine it lasting several weeks, before I use up a 30 ml bottle using 1-3 units ( or is it 10-30 units ? … the marks on the syringe dividing it into 10 units per syringe).  I see they have bacteriostatic water with benzoyl alcohol (.9% maybe) as a preservative.  Obviously that’d be ideal, but then my wife will probably see it and lose her shit.  I’d rather use something I can buy locally, from a pharmacy like Walgreens.   I saw this stuff claiming to be sterile water, super filtered , called MyPuremist , for a nasal spray machine.  
      There already measured to 30 ml, but will it prevent bacteria, molds , or fungi from growing in the solution over 2-3 weeks?    I’ve still got my last bottle that used Poland spring water to make my solution, but that was a month ago.. would I be crazy to IV or IM that batch of solution? What about oral use?

ODSM-T Pack Landed Yesterday,8,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1aob0zc/odsmt_pack_landed_yesterday/,"I finally received my order after a 3 day wait that felt like forever.

Some infos about Cychlorphine,15,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1al0lqs/some_infos_about_cychlorphine/,"Sup everyone,  
I tried the Cychlorphine today and can give some dosage and solubility infos.

It doesn't dissolve in water, but it does in PG when you add a tiny bit of Ethanol. I used about 0,5ml of Vodka to dissolve about 30mg and added 9,5ml of PG afterwards.   


I don't have much of a tolerance, but need about double the dose with any opioid out there naturally (no, I have not fried my receptors. I was always like that.)

I only vaped it in my e-cig with 3mg/ml. 2-3 puffs and I am feeling it. Start with 1,5mg/ml and titrate upwards if needed. It is warm and euphoric, but not as awesome as some other people said.   


It's alright, but nothing crazy. And defo not 4x the potency of Fent.   
Please take care if you want to try it. Only dose if you can make a volumetric solution.  

Edit: Stop asking me about vendors, I won‘t help you. If you can’t find a vendor, you probably don’t know about the dangers with such highly potent substances

Cychlorphine (Brophine Analogue) a report and harm reduction.,35,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1aii1bg/cychlorphine_brophine_analogue_a_report_and_harm/,"CYCHLORPHINE is a benzimidazolone derivative with potent opioid effects which has been sold as a designer drug, around 4times stronger than fentany. Unlike other opioid families, where N-cyanoethylation leads to a mixed bag of potency modulating effects (usually in the negative direction), the N(3)-cyanoethyl of the benzimidazolone series imparts some impressive MOR activity far in excess of what would normally be expected by this unusual substitution. Unique to the benzimidazolones are the potency enhancing effects of the N(3)-cyanoethyl analogues. 

I would like to preface this by saying that I have a rather large tolerance, do not use any of my dosages as a guideline to this drug. 

I'd also like to say that I'm a daily Metonitazene user via IV route and frequently use through out the day. 

My preferred method to dissolving nitazenes as they are hard to dissolve is by using reconstitution solution. This is a solution continuing 0.9 benzyl alcohol. The solution doubles as a bacteriostatic preservative but also really helps dissolve tricky nitazenes lile Metonitazene, Protonitazene, Isotanitazene and the one that was the hardest that made me research this is N-Desethylisotonitazene. 

Below is a picture of the brand I purchase from Amazon however any 0.9 benzyl alcohol solution should suffice. 

https://i.imgur.com/Tflz2DR.png

Cychlorphine is an absolutely analogue of Brophine, while I didn't find Brophine all that euphoric or warm Cychlorphine for sure takes the cake above any nitazenes except maybe Isotanitazene and N-Desethylisotonitazene. 

I did a test dose of 10mg IV and felt traditional opioid effects within minutes of the injection. Effects lasted about 4 hours before gradually decreasing over the next 6 hours in total. 

After that I tried a dose of about just under 20mg and holy fuck, what a god damn euphoric opioid this is. The reports I found on some European and Norwegian forums were 100% right on the money. 

My source only sent me 1g as a sample but after experiencing it I'm going to put a rather large order before this gets discontinued or completely scheduled where you can't find it anymore. 

I will link a few anecdotal screenshots from a different forum below. This post was aimed at harm reduction, education and information to help other users continue to safely use. 

I hope I accomplished that, you guys stay safe. I will be doing a review of N-Pyrrolidino Protonitazene soon so stay posted and stay safe.

"O-DSMT gave me back my life in a way Suboxone never could, and I feel like more people should hear this method!",31,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/1ack15i/odsmt_gave_me_back_my_life_in_a_way_suboxone/,"So I've had well over a decade of opiate addiction to all sorts of substances. I'll start with a breakdown of my history so you understand the level of addiction I've delt with in my life. 

I started in my teenage years with oxy, back when they were good the original formula. I enjoyed them until opana hit my area. They hit so much better it made oxy seem pointless. I thought I was truly addicted at this point and so did my uneducated family. So I was put on methadone for 6 months at which point my psychiatrist put me on Adderall and kpins (the Adderall I abused at the time the kpins I took as prescribed until eventually I tapered off just in case then I sold them for other drugs eventually), and i had to get off the methadone. I experienced full withdrawal for the first time over the 4 days the clinic made me wait until they started the two months Suboxone taper I got them to agree too. It was horrible maybe I didn't use my kpins as prescribed that time, maybe I took the whole bottle on days 2, 3, and 4 because id gone from 165mg methadone to nothing overnight. I took 60 1mg kpins in those three days and still couldn't sleep that was my first time in hell. You see I didn't even use daily when they put me in the clinic. I may have been forming a habit but I was not physically dependant, but I had a turn of luck and the controlled taper on Suboxone from the clinic worked wonders. 2 month taper they administered and at the end of the two months I experienced no withdrawal. Then came a few years of festivals, molly sales, MXE and most of all what seemed like endless money. Somewhere in the middle was a raid based on 6 months of surveillance from an apartment pigs rented with clear view. Even with high tek listening gear they sprung the trap and hour too early. Lucky me who's name isn't on the lease, and wasn't home because I was picking up the 6 keys of molly they were there for. Next came paranoia I went to a new city found a few people at a few dubstep clubs and unloaded what I didn't take. Same with the MXE at the time it was legal and I never did have to talk to the feds, but I knew they knew who I was. My father is military and the SBI approached him about me, and he's a muggle, but the one time he showed some balls was warning me. Once it was all gone I was left exhausted, and suffering serotonin syndrome. There were new opanas on the market you had to grind em with a Dremel they were so hard, and they fucked up your nose so everyone was shooting them. I was tired enough to try it, and in an instant I understood heroin without ever having done it! When I did actually try it it was a letdown honestly. After a few years of a heavy opana addiction I did eventually switch to h (real shit) because it was cheaper, and the withdrawal wasn't as bad. Then fentanyl analogs started to be sold, and I switched to those as the habit was way way cheaper for a while. Eventually I could turkeyed and stayed off opiates for a while then I found tianeptine, which I stopped briefly for u47700 before going back on tianeptine for years. The withdrawal takes the cake because without tianeptine your ass will withdrawal as it's also a tricyclic antidepressant. I could get thru a shift with fentydope(was on the scene by then), and ice but I mean that's just getting through it. That's how I quit tianeptine, and I stayed on dope till I od'd and met my now fiance. Then I went on subs, but for me I feel like subs just hit pause on the problem. I don't think any of the times I've been on subs really helped. Eventually I relapsed, and wound up in jail for 3 months it sucked but it put me far enough from everything to gain a measure of self control, just enough to realize I needed to get my mmj card and get on subs. I stayed that way for 2.5 years and eventually it started to make me feel like it was preventing me from treating my mental health as I have pretty severe ADHD & epilepsy combined with panic disorder and social anxiety. I thought I'd be strong enough with the meds I would be getting and kratom, but I was wrong. This brings me to the more relevant point of our story....

My 3 week rapid taper was way too fast, and headshot kratom wasn't doing shit except for twenty dollar extract shots that made me feel ok for an hour. It wasn't any past the first day that I was trying to get a hold of O-DSMT, and with all the years of experience in this ever-changing market it didn't take me long to find it. This was the beginning of last summer and the progress I see now is unreal. At first I took only O-DSMT, and at whatever dose I needed to not be sick, and eventually I started to be able to feel it. This was when I had started to read up on small batch kratom which led me to a small batch source who I see more as a friend now. I started with small steps you know, I learned how to make an exceptionally efficient delicious tea that I started replacing doses of O-DSMT with high dosees of kratom. Went until I got down to 1-2 reasonable doses of O-DSMT which I am still tapering a day. It's about 50/50 on days that I do one or two doses, but I feel it so much more than the hard shit, and even the kratom I feel more than I was feeling fent towards the end. I am closer to being off O-DSMT and down to just kratom than I am to the last sub I took. This method gave me something more valuable too, it gave me back my self control. My fiance has no clue that we spend more than we make and yet somehow we are starting to build wealth for the first time in a long time. 

O-DSMT gave me something methadone and subs never could and I just feel like this information should be out there.",1/27/24 20:23,

Which is best and most importantly, WHY?",4,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/190gz3m/n_desethyl_isotonitazene_etonitazepyne/,"I know there's a fair amount of info around on each of these substances including subjective effects, preferred ROAs, etc., but what I need to know is out of these 4 which one is the best and why? Like if you had all 4 in front of you and could only choose to have one for the rest of your life, which one would it be and why? Also, I'd love to hear your preferred ROA and preparation instructions. Thus far my preferred ROA for nitazenes is vaping off of foil, but I've only done it with etazene and etomethazene, but both were very pleasurable experiences and both chems vaporized  cleanly, i.e., not leaving a nasty black residue. I've heard that Desethyl Isoto can be vaped off foil as well, but that it leaves a nasty black crusty residue which in my experience has been indicative to it not vaping efficiently in the first place - like it would work but you're wasting a whole lot just to get a decent hit. E.g., with etazene and etomethazene there didn't seem to be any wasted material and there was no black residue, whereas when smoking things that leave a black residue I've been able to get a hit off of it but it took way more material to actually get a small hit because so much was wasted. So although I prefer smoking, I don't want to waste money getting a material that is technically smokeable but burns black and icky and is very wasteful of the material. So out of the 4 mentioned materials I'd like to know if you've got experience smoking them and most importantly how effective and efficient was it? Does it burn cleanly, does it taste smooth? - Etazene and Etometh both tasted semi-sweet, reminiscent of raw fent back in the day. I'm not averse to going with something that doesn't smoke well if its effects and potency justify it. In an ideal world everything would smoke like the etazene and etometh, but I've read many reports that most of the zenes don't smoke so well and are often wasteful. So let me have please, any input on the 4 I mentioned regarding potency, effects, tolerance, and ROA would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone, and be safe!",1/7/24 2:13,

Anyways I use bretazenil pretty often (once or twice a week maybe more) and notice benzo tolerance sticks around for awhile as for not using rcbenzos the prior months 6mg-10mg felt not that crazy although most definitely delusions of sobriety. 

Anyways enough of the past let's get onto the future and let me unpack this present, I already figuratively pulled the trigger on the inquiry and hope I do not literally pull the trigger on my life by accidentally overdosing upon just receiving this and opening it blindly. 

When handling the bags usually I just willy nilly open them as I've only gotten compounds active (for me) in the 1-5mg range, with CYCHLORPHINE being 4x the strength of fent and with the news teling naive people, me among them, that 1mg is deadly I assume treat this the same so 250mcg or 0.25mg is deadly?

So im considering approach & ROAs for these 3 conpounds, but especially the nd-eto & nd-iso, ive read theyre absurdly potent, like 1,000x morphine

So for proto, I'll probably start with 5mg/ml vape juice, i think it'll dissolve easily into a 50/50 PG/VG vape juice. Then from there increase mg/ml if needed.

Think ill be using the LVE Orion, GZ2 Luxe since they have variable voltage/wattage settings, especially the Orion 2

Should i use 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 subohm coils or 1.0 & 1.2 ohm coils?

Anyone have experience dissolving N-desethyl Etonitazene or Nd-isotonitazene in vape juice?

Or should i go the volumetric solution route? RO water or distilled water + a lil ethanol or benzylalcohol, or should i go water + saline + benzyl/eth? Or maybe add an acid like ascorbic/citric?

2-me-AP-237 is a synthetic opioid, related to AP-237, which is used in China. 

The ""standard"" dosage is 20mg oral, and the effects don't seem to get significantly better above 40mg. 

It is very caustic, so I would advice against any other use than oral and against using it more often than rarely.

It is fairly sedative, more euphoric than O-DSMT, less euphoric than tramadol and about on par with Tilidine. It's painkilling effects are surprisingly weak. It shouldn't have any other activity than on opioid receptors. It feels somewhat unique and not as bland as O-DSMT, but that doesnt mean it's any special.

Does this sound like any (shitty) opioid RC to you?,6,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/18n7uxk/does_this_sound_like_any_shitty_opioid_rc_to_you/,"So about a month ago I relapsed with 4.5 years clean. Yes I know huge regrets already. At first the dope was good, it was fire and felt like ferry has always felt. Then I found this one plug, the only one I don't have to fuck with a middle man. He's actually a really good plug, no waiting, he comes right out the house 30 seconds after I pull up, ahits always fat and he's not an arrogant dick head like many of them are. 
  But anyway this shit is not like any other opiate I've EVER done. I'm 39 and been fucking around in and off since I was 16-17ish. So for the effects the shit gets me well, barely any euphoria no body high, has about a 5 hr length. With this shit I'm either sick, well, or sleepy/nodding. Every opiate I've ever done gives me energy, some fent I'll hyper or borderline manic. Not this shit. I can literally do a line and go to bed. Could this shit he tranq with a bit of fetty in it or does it sound like some shitty less desirable RC?

TLDR Street dope doesn't feel like fetty at all. Gets me well, no euphoria no matter how much I do, no body high, no energy like EVERY OTHER opiate EVER has given me. I'm either sick, well, or sleeping. Yes it feels more like sleeping than a nod.

furanyl-fentanyl  is 1/5 Fentanyl or 20x Morphine

Etomethazene according to wikipedia is 20x Morphine

So the vendor's description must be talking about potency before cutting the product even thought the pure product listing does not have the same description

Since the active ingredient is only  20%, the product should be about 4x Morphine right?

Also anyone have an experience with this product with little or no tolerance? How long was the initial high/rush, and after effects? Only an occasional opiate user oxy 30-40mg but since I'm being drug tested I can no longer use oxy.

I am not 100% sure of purity but it def made me want more and before I knew it I find myself having WDs.

Even on the 16 mg sub shot that u get monthly I feel kinda shaky and crave like a mf. Until now I never really pulled thru with WD but after reaching this point I really wanna get rid of it before I hit the point of no return. 

So assuming the subs were in my system the whole time - how do I get myself back to baseline? I have been diluting the PV liquid I was using more and more but with so strong substances and the urge to redose as well as avavibility it has been hard as fuck to say no. Especially considering that I need to go to work too.

I have access to Pregabalin, Methadone, street H and Benzos to cure my symptoms. Would you advise me to get rid of the remaining eto at once? Should I call in sick for the next week? Or how long will the kick last - assuming I start right now?

Thx for reading this and much love to anyone out there struggling with this shit. Even more love for anyone willing to share some advice abt how to handle this shit.

Hello,

First things first: I made it. Not exactly when I hoped to as I had another Bettler incoming and my willpower wasnt large enough to just say no when I was in WD. Still, I tried to use conservatively and after running out the week after I went into WD. I called in sick and got myself some Pregabalin 300, Doxepin and Methadone. To add I was already on sublocade but eto cut thru that like a hot knife thru butter in July and the 16mg equivalent Dose I was on barely held me conscious after eto.

Use:
In the end I was using obscene Amounts (2,5ml a 30mg/ml a hit) so it wasnt cheap at all. Mainly the sides made me wanna quit. I experienced a bad cough and felt sick from using it, couldnt eat for the life of me and only thought about using and having more. It's a very caustic chemical and has some disso vibes to it, unfortunately it is veeeeeery fiendish. Last bottle I had, 70ml of 30mg/ml, was gone in maybe 7 days, being generous here. It creeps up on ya. At first I was amazed by the possibility of having an equivalent stash size of a Ki of H for maybe half a months pay. But that is fake advertising and opiate tolerant ppl like me will need more than advertised 0,3-0,5mg to feel it. And once u start using zenes ur tolly goes up like I wish my crypto portfolio did. The effects were comparable to other opiates but I always felt like I was poisoned after high doses. I had some good nods but the fiendishness and ease of getting it rn had me use like 7Gs in 6-8 Weeks with a day or two most in-between.
So after that short honeymoon phase I posted here the first time, partly bc in here I read some horrendous shit and I knew it will be now or never for me. I had some days off I could use to pay the piper

WDs:

The first 2-3 Days were worst. Of these the first 24h were hell. I tapered the 3 days going up to it using some way of the Chinese formula: just filling the bottle with more vape juice when I put some in the vape. Still had to vape every 2h tho.

Day 0: Sunday I took my last Eto around noon and then began my regimen. Took 1 Lyrica and 120mg of methadone once I felt really sick after maybe 4-5h. I could feel it leaving my body bit by bit. I tried to suffer bc I had limited meds and I knew that if I used them all in a semi fucked state I wld fuck myself on monday even more. So I went thru initial WD, took a sleeping pill to get a few h in and waited for better days to hit.

Day 1: I had to take 3 x 300mg Lyrica, 20mg Diaz and about 200g of methadone throughoutthat day and I STILL felt it. Mainly mentally ofc but chills, the runs, shakiness of hands and inability to sit still was still pronounced. My mental state was especially fucked, I was paranoid and reclusive since my senses opened up again and it was a bit too much for my doped up mind.

Day 2 I took 120mg Methadone, 20mg diaz and 2 Lyrica 300 which calmed me down, still was shakey and it was hard to concentrate. I started cleaning up the mess that was my life and apartment. Not being constantly numbed I was able to take action in a slowly but surely.

Day 3:  I ran out of my comfort medication and had to go shopping, felt like shit until I got in about 80mg Methadone, a fent patch and 2 Lyrica. First day that I felt kinda sober and clear tbh, ok fent hugged me for the evening but I managed to be a better friend, Partner and son already just by communicating directly. I gave myself a rest day before preparing to return to the office on Thursday.

Day 4: first day of work. I took 80mg of Methadone and 600 mg Lyrica which kept me alive and well. Some crumbs of amp sulfate (real low dose) in my coffee helped too lol. went to the gym at night for the first time and felt good enough to smoke a doobie at night. I abstained from thc before bc it gets me in a weird paranoid state when I am in deep WD. That night I felt well, got a few h of sleep in here and there, I started feeling proud of myself again.

Day 5: today, I had 100mg of methadone and 1 Lyrica bc I am scared of Lyrica dependence. I will scale them out from now if I feel better. WD symptoms have gone to 0 but due to double opioid meds and pregabalin/benzos in my system Idk if I am over the hump or it just dulls it. Went to the gym, crushed it at work and ima go see my GF now that symptoms have abated. She knows I am an addicr but doesn't use so i keep her out of it. I feel no more WD symptoms but the clear mindedness fucks with mex goddammit I hate addiction. If u use u wanna quit and once u quit u wanna use. Just fucking stupid what we're doing to ourselves in the pursuit of Nirvana. 

Day 6: tomorrow, 70mg methadone and 2 Lyrica in reserve. Will try to hold off from the methadone and keep the Lyrica down and taper off. Didn't use it before so a week won't give me WDs I hope. I will update this with my experience and let u know how it goes. I hope I am over the hump of eto WDs and can just taper down the Done and Lyrica over a few days until the sublocade holds me on its own. 

So for any future researchers: don't do it. It sounds too good to be true for one reason - it absolutely isnt true the way u imagine it to be. I will steer clear of zenes for sure now, I'd rather get myself a bag of real good onion H and take a weekend holiday before getting the sub shot again. 

With that out of the way I hope this helps if u do end up fucking around with this stuff. I know I was looking like a maniac when in WD and would've appreciated a diary like this to gage the measures taken. 

From all the WDs I had (H, Methadone, Morphine, Subs and this now) I rate this a 8/10 on day 1, 6 on d2, 5 on d3, 4 on d4, 3 pn d5. 10 being absolutely unending point, naltrexone on a yearly habit PWD type of WD. The first 24h def delt like hell bc of the intensity of cravings kicking in - that's why I could not quit knowing i have another bottle waiting in storage. and maybe the Amount of medicine I used was overkill but from what I read other ppl went thru I wanted to be safe. Meds made it bearable and me funktional enough to work and care for myself. Maybe the relatively short time (8 wk max) helped me bounce back. 
Maybe also the half life of eto (2-4h if I had to guess) helped, Maybe it was all of these together. I know that in another World it would have been the Hospital to get off this shit or just not Quittung and using zeens as MT (garbage idea imo but to each his own).


 I am really really fucking happy I got out before it got real grimey and I lost everything I built back up again. My inner addict wouldn't let me enjoy an opioid with the strength of fent and duration of Crack, whaddaya know.
A shame, I'd fall for an opioid rc with a x10-x20 potency. But these high potency caustic af vape mixes u get are Nothing but a menace to our bodies. Maybe not as much as shooting dirty H with a used needle but still. 
The cough I had until yesterday kinda proves my point here. And don't get me started on synthesis errors and the vendors being open to debate about them.
With vape juice being sold on the open I guess we will be in for some scheduling as soon as the powers that be find some dead kid in his bed and we get some moms on CNN/ARD/whatever MSM runs in your area. 

Tbh I could even see this stuff infiltrating the local H supply. Not like street junkies or dealers give 2 shits, it gets u high and it gets made here instead of imported from Afghanistan. And once ur hooked on this shit good luck feeling the 5% diamorphine H they sell here to the poorest of the poor. So they go back to the one dude until all of them only sell zenes. Like fent in the USA.

But enough bla bla bla from me. Hope this is any use to any degenerates like me in the future and now. Don't be scared of the shit ppl tell u about zene WDs - if u plan ahead and take your time with tapering before jumping you will be fine. At least with this one.

I have experiences with Etazene, Metonitazene, Metonitazepyne, Protonitazepyne, Methomethazene and Etomethazene.
Last weekend I smoked around 200mg Etomethazene, just as example how high my tolerance is. Or as another example: Right now I have 300mg ODSMT intus and no effects, just no WD symptons. To get high I would need over 1g in a few hours.

Can I take fentanyl for n-desethyl-isotonitazene withdrawal,12,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Opioid_RCs/comments/180mnpd/can_i_take_fentanyl_for_ndesethylisotonitazene/,"Hey hoping you guys can help me. Tl;dr at the bottom.

So I ordered some of what I thought was butonitazene a while ago, at the time I had a very large fentanyl tolerance but started with the buto really small just to be safe. It ended up having a much higher potency than I expected and the amount I purchased lasted me WAY longer than I was expecting as well. Before it ran out I ordered some more butonitazene but when it came it was a completely different color and consistency. I chalked it up to just being a different batch or process, but I finally started to run out of the first batch I had so I switched to the other just to see, and it is absolutely not the same thing..

After some research I think I was actually sold n-desethyl-isotonitazene, based on these factors:

1. It was a very pale yellow color
2. It wasn’t caustic at all, I had no irritation or issues whatsoever
3. It had really long legs and I could sometimes go for 8-12 hours or so before redosing (although recently it’s been more like every 4 :(  )
4. It’s not water soluble

Anyways, now I’m terrified that what I thought was a fairly weak zeke was actually the strongest one you can find and I’m not sure anything I have can help with the withdrawals.. I have the second batch of buto of course, and a fair amount of fentanyl. I also have something that was sold to me as either isotonitazene, or some form of it (I can’t remember and the place I got it is gone now) but I don’t really trust it as it was during that time where everyone was saying that it didn’t exist, and this one is like a copperish brown color, which I’m not sure matches up with what I’ve seen on iso online.

Do you think fentanyl will help with withdrawal if I just take enough of it? Or has it crushed my fentanyl tolerance out of existence? I remember after switching to fent, if I tried to go back to H it just wouldn’t do anything at all whatsoever, even if I did an “equivalent” amount in morphine units or whatever. Thank you for any input!

tl;dr
I thought I was taking buto for a really long time and i believe now that it was n-desethyl-isotonitazene. Is it possible to fight withdrawals from this with fentanyl? Or will nothing less help at all? What kindof withdrawal am I in for? Thank you for any help or info you can give me!

However, with zenes, they do not dissolve in water or saline evenly. This poses a problem for researchers who need a solution for safe and consistent volumetric dosing in test subjects.

Hypothetically speaking of course, If a scientist were to prepare a solution for a zene opioid to be dissolved into evenly, what would be the best solution to use?

I’ve only ever tried metonitazene from the main Chinese lab purchased about 1.5yrs ago but I believe the batch I bought (light yellow/white powder)  was not a good one because it was horrible tasting when smoked off of foil or vaped in pg solution and it burned incredibly bad to snort. I honestly couldn’t say how strong it’s effects were since it was almost impossible to I hear enough to feel it.  So with that said I would like to know if anyone has had good results smoking any of the currently available ones off of foil and how was the taste since this is very important to me.

I personally found that my regular dope was honestly stronger than the etomethazene. It felt like my face was on fire, to the point I really didnt notice any other “positive” effects. I did a dose of about a .4 and literally felt like my face was going to explode. Curious about whether anyone else had the same experience, along with your opinion on the substance. I only ordered it the one time, it took almost 4 weeks to arrive. I found one other person who ordered from the same source, they had a similar experience. This was over a year and a half ago.

A theoretically perfect opioid would a have super high affinity for the Mu receptors and zero affinity for kappa/G-protein although I'm pretty sure thats a fantasy. But whats preventing them from synthesizing rcs more similar to traditional opioids? Or is just them trying to milk all the current chems as much they can until they get banned before they move on to something else?,4/28/23 5:01,
